People are closing their position, taking profits, or need money for the end of 2024. Dont worry, this time of the year is always weird to look at. But most of the time, early in the new year, people start buying back. I also think this time is going to be different. As soon as trump comes in(Jan 20th), he wants to make crypto a priority. Whoâ€™s with me?...

## Take Profits or Patience?

If you bought XRP at $0.70 and made thousands of dollars like me, do you think it makes sense to take profits now before it dips again to like 1,5$ and buy in later cheaper, or would you wait to see if the price rises leading up to Trump's inauguration on January 20th and the potential dismissal of the lawsuit on January 15, 2025?


What's your strategy, and how do you see XRP performing in January and February?

I see ethereum market cap and liquidity being drained into xrp one day. Ethereum's gas fees are crazy. It's slower than solana and I think xrp is the future....

Why will financial institutions adopt XRP? I see a lot of "hopium" in the crypto world. I would like cold, hard facts as to why you think XRP has a future. Why XRP over ETH or Bitcoin, for example? Why wouldnâ€™t banks choose a different coin or system instead?...

I use Robinhood to buy XRP. It's simple and easy. Any downside. Will build up to 1000. Really want to get 10,000 and hold with diamond hands until 10$. Once Trump unleashes Crypto, could see Big money embrace XRP...

Already in on xrp at sub .70 avg , small amount of btc as well at low avg.
