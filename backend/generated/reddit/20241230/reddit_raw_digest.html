<p>The chart looks insanely bullish. We can observe how the 2025 alt season is going to unfold, especially for XRP, which is being adopted by central banks worldwide. XRP will be globally adopted as a payment system, while Bitcoin serves as digital gold.</p>
<p>The strong XRP community has made it a top contender in the rankings, and it will continue to grow. The new year is going to bring very exciting opportunities within the XRP ecosystem, with the potential for it to be used as a global currency.

<p>Why is that XRP price is at 2.24 and when I purchase it , snd when i purchase-it, it charges me at 2.31 ! I have purchased many times on this exchange and this happens all the time. They are not only charging you a trading fee but they are gouging you this way! I will be filing a SEC complaint against Uphold! I hope others will do the same. This is totally robbery! I hope you will also file a complaint against them and their unethical practices and deception....</p>

 I feel that BTC will bottom at 92.5k, ETH will see 4.5k in early spring and SOL will be back at 250 in no time. Any other coins/projects I should be considering..?

Already in on xrp at sub .70 avg , small amount of btc as well at low avg.
I have done some research and have an idea of how I wanna do it.

</ul>
<p>As quantum computing continues to advance, concerns about its potential impact on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency security are gaining traction. The cryptographic algorithms that protect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on principles that quantum computers might eventually break.</p>
<p>Is this a realistic concern, or are these fears exaggerated? How soon could quantum computing pose a threat, and what measures can be taken to safeguard the crypto ecosystem?</p>

<p>Someone can explain this transaction to me? The last transaction (ID 99e57af92e123ea822ba72d4a3a4d8374f4ebae6d4a71081843d611a59b0e9a9) from the adress: 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S.</p>

<p>Why I Don’t Think Crypto Can Replace <strong>FIAT</strong></p>
<p>After extensive research and reflection on cryptocurrency, I believe that nearly all technologies in the cryptosphere won’t succeed. The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: <strong>trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.</strong></p>

<p>I've just read that people affected by the LastPass hack have had their crypto stolen.</p>
<p>I thought the idea of crypto was the Blockchain was uncorrutable and you could trace all transactions?</p>
<p>Surely if someone steels your crypto it's a case of following the electronic trail?</p>

<p>Is it safe to keep crypto with exchange or should it store somewhere else and what are options and how do you do that? I am not familiar with other options but heard about cold/hot wallets (tbh don't understand it), this whole crypto and block chain is super complicated, even you read theory but in practical kind of crazy to understand how it functions lol</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!...</p>

<p>This Altcoin season is going to make some rich and some cry like babies in the end.</p>
<p>Everyone can't be winners, there will be losers this pump cycle for sure. When someone sells at the top, there always someone who bought at the top thinking there was more profit to be made. Many of these alt coins and meme coins have pump super fast in a course of days and week or two. But just in reverse, it will come crashing down just as fast, and if you waited too long, or keep thinking the price was never ...</p>

<p>Looking at the hourly BTC chart it looks like there's a Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic playing out (Google it if you are unfamiliar). So far BTC has hit all the major stages and events such as selling climax (SC), secondary test (ST), Test and seems to be in phase c at the moment. I know that TA alone is not really helpful when it comes to price movement predictions. However, sometimes it helps to assess the potential direction of an asset. Having said that, if BTC will complete the text book Wy...</p>
