[00:00:00] every 4 years the crypto Market
[00:00:01] experiences exponential gain and the
[00:00:04] last time this happened was 2021 so
[00:00:08] logically it suggests that 2025 is going
[00:00:11] to be a massive year for crypto prices
[00:00:15] and this has everyone asking questions
[00:00:17] like how high will crypto go when will
[00:00:20] it stop and if we're going to get
[00:00:22] another bare Market or are we going to
[00:00:24] enter a crypto super cycle today we're
[00:00:27] going to give you the answers speciic
[00:00:29] spefically we're going to give you our
[00:00:31] predictions about what's going to happen
[00:00:33] to the crypto Market in 2025 my name is
[00:00:36] Nick and this is a video you literally
[00:00:39] cannot afford to
[00:00:41] miss our first crypto prediction for
[00:00:43] 2025 is that the market will rally much
[00:00:46] more than most investors expect and this
[00:00:49] is simply because of the structural
[00:00:51] changes that the crypto Market is likely
[00:00:53] to experience in the coming months a
[00:00:56] simple example is the introduction of
[00:00:58] more spot crypto ETFs
[00:01:00] in case you missed the news a spot ETF
[00:01:02] applications have been filed for cryptos
[00:01:05] like salana and xrp with chairman Gary
[00:01:09] Gensler set to step down in January and
[00:01:11] new crypto regulations set to be passed
[00:01:14] by Congress sometime early next year the
[00:01:17] chances are that these ETFs will be
[00:01:19] approved as well as many others and this
[00:01:22] will cause the prices of these cryptos
[00:01:24] to pump much more than most people
[00:01:26] expect exactly like they did with BTC
[00:01:29] when the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched
[00:01:32] earlier this year and this begs the
[00:01:34] question of what will happen to all the
[00:01:37] other altcoins that don't get spot ETFs
[00:01:40] and the answer is bullish there too in
[00:01:44] case you haven't noticed crypto
[00:01:45] exchanges in the US have started listing
[00:01:48] more altcoins precisely because they
[00:01:50] don't need to worry about the SEC
[00:01:52] cracking down on them anymore and the
[00:01:54] number of new listings will likely
[00:01:56] accelerate early next year creating the
[00:01:58] kinds of inflows required for 100x gains
[00:02:02] but what about the stimulus I hear you
[00:02:04] ask after all the only reason why crypto
[00:02:07] rallied so much in 2021 was because of
[00:02:10] the stimy checks
[00:02:12] right wrong if you've been keeping up
[00:02:15] with the channel you'll know that we
[00:02:17] summarized a research report from the
[00:02:19] FED which found that only
[00:02:22] 0.02% of stimi checks went into crypto
[00:02:26] let me repeat 0.02%
[00:02:30] it's absolutely minuscule even though
[00:02:32] some people had the luxury of sitting at
[00:02:34] home and speculating on mean stocks and
[00:02:37] altcoins most of the world was busy
[00:02:39] trying to survive the pandemic and its
[00:02:42] Associated restrictions this time around
[00:02:45] things aren't looking too hot either but
[00:02:48] the economy is objectively in a much
[00:02:50] better shape than it was back then and
[00:02:53] people are less busy so to speak at the
[00:02:56] same time the economy is just weak
[00:02:58] enough that Central banks are starting
[00:03:00] to stimulate all while millions of
[00:03:03] people around the world are desperate to
[00:03:05] make a quick back to get ahead and these
[00:03:08] create the optimal conditions for crypto
[00:03:10] Market rallies that are bigger than most
[00:03:12] investors expect For Better or For Worse
[00:03:16] and by the way if you enjoying this
[00:03:18] video so far be sure to smash that like
[00:03:20] button to let us know and don't forget
[00:03:22] to subscribe and ping the notification
[00:03:24] Bell as well so you don't miss our next
[00:03:27] one now our second crypto prediction for
[00:03:30] 2025 follows from the first and that's
[00:03:33] that the crypto Market will Top much
[00:03:35] earlier or much later than most
[00:03:37] investors expect and that's just because
[00:03:40] everyone has become accustomed to
[00:03:42] crypto's 4-year cycle for context
[00:03:44] whenever there's a consensus view in
[00:03:47] investing the opposite tends to happen
[00:03:51] in this case it could mean the crypto
[00:03:52] Market hitting its cycle top earlier or
[00:03:55] later than investors expect uh for
[00:03:57] reference most investors expect the
[00:03:58] crypto Market to hit its cycle top
[00:04:01] sometime in the second half of next year
[00:04:04] and that's just because the market tops
[00:04:06] of the last two crypto Cycles took place
[00:04:08] in age2 naturally this increases the
[00:04:11] likelihood that the crypto Market will
[00:04:13] either top in the first half of next
[00:04:16] year or sometime in 2026 and it's easy
[00:04:20] to see how it could go both ways
[00:04:22] particularly when you factor in our
[00:04:24] first prediction about the crypto Market
[00:04:26] going higher than expected because of
[00:04:28] changes in Market structure if the
[00:04:30] crypto Market tops in the first half of
[00:04:33] next year it will likely be because of a
[00:04:35] bullish crypto specific factor that
[00:04:38] causes a massive pump followed by a
[00:04:40] bearish macro factor that causes all
[00:04:43] markets to crash for example the US
[00:04:46] government could announce a strategic
[00:04:48] Bitcoin Reserve shortly before the world
[00:04:50] enters a 2008 style recession that
[00:04:54] results in a massive market crash across
[00:04:56] the board if the crypto Market tops some
[00:04:59] time in 2026 it will likely be because
[00:05:02] the bullish crypto specific factors
[00:05:05] continued while the macro backdrop
[00:05:07] remained bullish or at least not bearish
[00:05:10] enough to tank the markets for instance
[00:05:13] we could see Mass adoption of crypto at
[00:05:15] an individual and institutional scale
[00:05:18] that results in organic growth not
[00:05:20] driven by speculation
[00:05:23] [Music]
[00:05:28] [Applause]
[00:05:39] the coin Bureau deals page it won't make
[00:05:41] you stronger but it will make you better
[00:05:43] at
[00:05:48] crypto and this ties into our third
[00:05:51] prediction for 2025 and that's that
[00:05:53] crypto will see true Mass adoption in
[00:05:57] other words people will use crypto for
[00:05:59] more more than just speculation we
[00:06:01] reckon it's likely that things like
[00:06:03] stable coin payments will become normal
[00:06:05] and permanently adopted by millions of
[00:06:07] people obviously this will be especially
[00:06:10] bullish for the smart contract cryptos
[00:06:12] which support these use cases in the
[00:06:15] case of stable coin payments it appears
[00:06:17] that coinbase's base could become the
[00:06:19] main chain for usdc payments while
[00:06:22] salana looks well positioned to be the
[00:06:25] main chain for py USD payments now while
[00:06:28] Tron is likely to still dominate usdt
[00:06:31] payments blockchains like Aptos and sui
[00:06:34] could also command a significant share
[00:06:36] of this of course Bas doesn't have a
[00:06:38] token at least not yet and this means
[00:06:41] that usdc payments on Bas will likely be
[00:06:43] bullish for coinbase's stock as for
[00:06:46] salana Tron Aptos and sui it really
[00:06:49] depends on how much adoption their
[00:06:52] payment offerings get honestly it's a
[00:06:54] bit too soon to say but uh that Showdown
[00:06:57] is coming in 2025
[00:07:00] and what about the small caps that could
[00:07:02] benefit from payments I hear you ask
[00:07:05] after all sold TRX AP or already large
[00:07:08] caps I want small caps that will
[00:07:11] 100x well here's a hint where there are
[00:07:16] payments there are also savings and we
[00:07:19] believe that the payment offerings by
[00:07:20] Bas salana abos and sui will add crypto
[00:07:24] savings protocols to their backends and
[00:07:27] if you're wondering exactly which saving
[00:07:29] protocols they could use this is the
[00:07:32] kind of alpha you'll find on the coin
[00:07:34] Bureau club and that's where we review
[00:07:36] promising small cap cryptos every week
[00:07:38] and explore emerging narratives like
[00:07:41] crypto savings you can become a member
[00:07:44] of the coin Bureau Club using the link
[00:07:46] down in the description now our fourth
[00:07:49] crypto prediction for 2025 is one that
[00:07:51] people are starting to talk a bit more
[00:07:53] about and that's that decentralized
[00:07:55] exchanges AKA dexas will flip
[00:07:58] centralized exchanges or Sexes by
[00:08:01] trading volume and this sounds crazy
[00:08:04] until you realize that more than 10% of
[00:08:07] all crypto trading is already happening
[00:08:10] on dex's and when you look at how much
[00:08:12] Dex volume has grown over time it starts
[00:08:15] to sound like it's inevitable and as you
[00:08:18] can see the ratio of sex to Dex trading
[00:08:20] volume has been going up and to the
[00:08:23] right since 2020 and if this trend
[00:08:26] continues Dex trading volume could
[00:08:28] approach even surpass 50% in
[00:08:32] 2025 in our view this trend is likely to
[00:08:36] continue and that's for two reasons the
[00:08:38] first is that user experience of dex's
[00:08:41] has increased exponentially in recent
[00:08:43] years case in point Solana's Phantom
[00:08:45] wallet recently flipped coinbase on the
[00:08:48] Apple App Store New slash but this
[00:08:50] suggests that more people are swapping
[00:08:52] crypto on Phantom than trading it on
[00:08:55] coinbase the second reason goes hand
[00:08:58] inhand with the first and that's that
[00:08:59] dexes are basically unregulated compared
[00:09:03] to Sexes consider that the reason why
[00:09:06] exchanges like bance got so big in the
[00:09:08] first place was because they didn't have
[00:09:11] any hurdles like kyc this created a low
[00:09:14] barrier to entry that allowed almost
[00:09:16] anyone to trade over there this time
[00:09:19] around it's dexas that have zero hurdles
[00:09:22] and when you combine this with the
[00:09:23] refined ux and increased cross chain
[00:09:26] functionality it creates a low barrier
[00:09:29] to ENT that allows anyone to trade just
[00:09:31] like they could do on centralized
[00:09:33] exchanges in Prior Cycles keep an eye on
[00:09:36] these dexes because their respective
[00:09:38] cryptos are probably going to rip and uh
[00:09:42] you already know where to get that kind
[00:09:44] of altcoin
[00:09:46] ala now our fifth crypto prediction for
[00:09:48] 2025 is one that uh nobody is talking
[00:09:52] about and that's that most Bitcoin
[00:09:54] mining I.E more than 50% of the hash
[00:09:57] rate will come from the UN United States
[00:10:00] as some of you might have heard Donald
[00:10:02] Trump said over the summer that he wants
[00:10:04] all remaining BTC to be made in America
[00:10:08] believe it or not but this is something
[00:10:11] that could actually happen now to put
[00:10:13] things into perspective it's estimated
[00:10:15] that roughly 30% of all Bitcoin mining
[00:10:18] is being done in the US already the idea
[00:10:21] that it could rise above 50% isn't as
[00:10:24] ridiculous as it seems because the trend
[00:10:26] is already headed in that direction not
[00:10:29] only that but hitting this Milestone
[00:10:31] wouldn't necessarily require an increase
[00:10:34] in American Bitcoin mining all that
[00:10:36] would need to happen is that less mining
[00:10:38] is being done elsewhere and that could
[00:10:41] push the US market share of Bitcoin
[00:10:42] mining above the 50% Mark and chances
[00:10:46] are it will be a combination of both
[00:10:49] make no mistake this presents serious
[00:10:52] centralization risks for Bitcoin uh
[00:10:54] since asset managers like Black Rock
[00:10:57] happen to be the largest shareholders in
[00:10:59] the publicly traded Bitcoin miners that
[00:11:01] are producing most of this new BTC more
[00:11:05] info about the risk that black rock
[00:11:06] poses to bitcoin right over
[00:11:08] here anyways our sixth crypto prediction
[00:11:11] for 2025 relates to the fourth and
[00:11:14] that's that a major Central Bank will
[00:11:16] add Bitcoin to its balance sheets what's
[00:11:19] interesting is that the Swiss National
[00:11:21] Bank said back in 2022 that it could buy
[00:11:24] BTC someday not surprisingly this
[00:11:27] headline seems to have been memory hold
[00:11:30] that's what happens during bare markets
[00:11:32] after all what is surprising though is
[00:11:34] that a major Central Bank seems to be
[00:11:36] seriously considering it evidence of
[00:11:39] this can be found in the fact that many
[00:11:41] of them including the ECB have been
[00:11:43] conducting studies about how BTC affects
[00:11:46] balance sheets and for those unfamiliar
[00:11:49] the ECB is probably the most anti-
[00:11:52] crypto Central Bank of all what's
[00:11:54] fascinating is that Trump's intention to
[00:11:56] create a strategic Bitcoin Reserve seems
[00:11:59] to to have significantly increased the
[00:12:01] chances that a major Central Bank will
[00:12:03] add BTC to its balance sheet and that's
[00:12:06] because creating a strategic Bitcoin
[00:12:08] Reserve could cause BTC to pump and as
[00:12:11] such anyone who front runs its creation
[00:12:14] could earn a massive return the idea is
[00:12:17] in fact lent weight by a recent proposal
[00:12:19] from Russian politicians to create their
[00:12:21] own strategic Bitcoin Reserve although
[00:12:24] this technically isn't the same thing as
[00:12:25] Russia's Central Bank buying BTC it
[00:12:28] brings the possibility one step closer
[00:12:32] it's easy to forget that major central
[00:12:34] banks will be the last to ape into
[00:12:36] Bitcoin but we believe the first one
[00:12:38] will do so in
[00:12:40] 2025 on that note our seventh prediction
[00:12:43] for 2025 is that a non-sanctioned
[00:12:45] country will start using crypto for
[00:12:48] international trade FYI sanctioned
[00:12:50] countries like Iran and Russia are
[00:12:52] reportedly already using crypto for
[00:12:54] international trade and chances are that
[00:12:56] North Korea is uh doing the same thing
[00:12:59] with all its stolen crypto loot in
[00:13:02] theory this is horrible because it means
[00:13:05] that well countries are evading
[00:13:07] sanctions and financing all sorts of
[00:13:10] questionable stuff in practice however
[00:13:12] this is a necessary step for
[00:13:14] non-sanctioned countries to follow suit
[00:13:17] put differently the use of crypto for
[00:13:19] international trade by sanctioned
[00:13:21] countries proves that it's possible for
[00:13:23] non-sanctioned countries to also do the
[00:13:26] same in this sense it's actually no
[00:13:28] different to what bitcoin's adoption was
[00:13:31] like when it began are the first people
[00:13:33] who actually used Bitcoin were mostly
[00:13:35] buying questionable stuff with it on the
[00:13:38] dark web but this eventually paved the
[00:13:40] way for Bitcoin to be used by Regular
[00:13:43] People and today most Bitcoin
[00:13:45] transactions have absolutely nothing to
[00:13:47] do with the dark web from our
[00:13:48] perspective we're seeing the same
[00:13:50] adoption curve occur at the nation state
[00:13:53] level it foreshadows a scenario where
[00:13:55] crypto isn't just being used by people
[00:13:57] to buy coffee with stable coins it will
[00:14:00] also be used by countries to transact
[00:14:02] between themselves I mean it already is
[00:14:05] but we think it's going to go truly
[00:14:07] International in
[00:14:09] 2025 say did you hear that tether
[00:14:12] recently facilitated an oil trade in
[00:14:16] usdt probably nothing speaking of which
[00:14:19] our eighth crypto prediction for 2025 is
[00:14:22] that countries will start mining Bitcoin
[00:14:25] now for those unaware many smaller
[00:14:26] governments are already mining Bitcoin
[00:14:29] most notably El Salvador and more
[00:14:31] recently Bhutan we believe a larger
[00:14:33] government will join the party in
[00:14:36] 2025 besides the fact that some
[00:14:38] governments will want to make an extra
[00:14:39] Buck by selling newly minted BTC some
[00:14:42] will also be incentivized to mine
[00:14:44] Bitcoin to ensure that its blockchain
[00:14:46] remains credibly neutral I recall that
[00:14:49] there's a chance that most Bitcoin
[00:14:51] mining could be done in the us as soon
[00:14:53] as next year this could be a problem if
[00:14:56] American Bitcoin miners start say
[00:14:59] refusing to process BTC transactions
[00:15:01] from countries like Russia and Iran as a
[00:15:04] matter of fact this has already happened
[00:15:07] at least twice in recent years in 2021
[00:15:10] Marathon digital one of the largest
[00:15:11] Bitcoin mining companies complied with
[00:15:14] us sanctions and in 2023 F2 pool one of
[00:15:19] the biggest Bitcoin mining pools did the
[00:15:21] same both backpedal shortly after though
[00:15:24] even so it doesn't change the fact that
[00:15:26] governments that are used in BTC for
[00:15:29] ational trade will be incentivized to
[00:15:31] ensure that this kind of onchain
[00:15:33] censorship doesn't happen in Practical
[00:15:35] terms this will motivate them to mine
[00:15:37] Bitcoin and run their own Bitcoin nodes
[00:15:40] not for economic reasons per se but to
[00:15:43] ensure that their BTC transactions
[00:15:46] always go through as a fun fact Fidelity
[00:15:49] one of the world's largest asset
[00:15:51] managers actually predicted something
[00:15:53] like this would happen it predicted that
[00:15:55] governments would start accumulating BTC
[00:15:58] because of quote high stakes Game Theory
[00:16:02] if I buy BTC I will be better off than
[00:16:04] my geopolitical rivals we believe the
[00:16:07] same could happen with Bitcoin mining in
[00:16:10] 2025 and that's a nice segue into our
[00:16:13] ninth crypto prediction for next year
[00:16:15] which is that privacy and identity will
[00:16:17] become two of the biggest crypto
[00:16:19] narratives particularly among
[00:16:21] institutional investors in short things
[00:16:23] like stable coin payments by individuals
[00:16:25] and Bitcoin reserves by institutions
[00:16:28] will make every everyone realize that
[00:16:30] onchain privacy essentially doesn't
[00:16:33] exist not sure who needs to hear it but
[00:16:36] unless you are using a privacy coin then
[00:16:38] all your transactions are public and can
[00:16:41] be viewed by anyone using a blockchain
[00:16:44] Explorer there are even blockchain
[00:16:46] analytics companies which track all of
[00:16:48] your transactions and share them with
[00:16:50] governments and uh whoever else and
[00:16:53] because you completed kyc on exchanges
[00:16:55] you're easy to track down you might not
[00:16:58] care about about this when you're just
[00:16:59] buying and holding crypto to speculate
[00:17:02] on its price but we can almost guarantee
[00:17:05] that you'll care when you're actively
[00:17:06] using crypto for things like payments
[00:17:09] you aren't going to want anyone to see
[00:17:11] how much crypto you have in your wallet
[00:17:13] or who you sending that crypto too if
[00:17:16] you're a government then you're
[00:17:18] definitely not going to want anyone to
[00:17:20] see these things and that's why we've
[00:17:22] been predicting for a long time that
[00:17:24] institutional investors will Lobby for
[00:17:26] strict crypto privacy regulations not
[00:17:29] for our sake but for their sake and it's
[00:17:32] possible that this will even result in
[00:17:34] privacy upgrades to bitcoin itself
[00:17:37] meanwhile these same institutions will
[00:17:39] want to see everything we're doing in
[00:17:41] extreme detail which is probably why
[00:17:44] they'll eventually demand that some kind
[00:17:45] of a digital identity is required to
[00:17:48] interact with the def5 protocols the
[00:17:50] same way it was eventually required to
[00:17:52] complete kyc to use a crypto exchange
[00:17:56] this might not happen until the next
[00:17:57] cycle though come to to think of it
[00:17:59] forcing digital ID for onchain
[00:18:02] interactions would likely require a
[00:18:04] catalyst of some kind to Justified like
[00:18:07] a massive hack or exploit which brings
[00:18:10] us to our final crypto prediction for
[00:18:12] 2025 and that's that there will be a
[00:18:15] crypto hack or exploit of a major entity
[00:18:18] most likely a crypto custodian this is
[00:18:21] actually a prediction that was made by
[00:18:22] bitm co-founder Arthur Hayes in an
[00:18:24] interview we did with him as well as Ral
[00:18:26] Paul a few months back the link will be
[00:18:29] down in the description for you guys the
[00:18:31] tldr is that Arthur thinks that a crypto
[00:18:33] custodian most likely a mega bank that
[00:18:35] doesn't know enough about crypto will
[00:18:38] get hacked to the tune of billions of
[00:18:40] dollars and because the FED can't print
[00:18:42] crypto tens of billions of crypto being
[00:18:45] stolen would likely trigger a massive
[00:18:47] crypto market crash that couldn't be
[00:18:49] easily recovered aside from the fact
[00:18:51] that this would be the perfect Catalyst
[00:18:53] to justify onchain kyc this could Mark
[00:18:58] the beginning or the end of the next
[00:19:00] crypto be market and if history repeats
[00:19:03] then the next crypto be Market could
[00:19:04] also occur by the end of 2025 but I'll
[00:19:07] reiterate that the crypto bull market
[00:19:10] could last longer than most investors
[00:19:12] expect in that case the next crypto be
[00:19:15] Market wouldn't come until
[00:19:17] 2026 and that's why we have no
[00:19:19] prediction about the timing of the
[00:19:21] crypto be Market at this time it's
[00:19:24] better not to jinx it after all still
[00:19:28] there's no question that there will be a
[00:19:30] crypto be Market again at some point and
[00:19:33] uh if we're correct about crypto going
[00:19:35] much higher than most investors expect
[00:19:37] uh the next crypto be Market could also
[00:19:39] take crypto much lower than investors
[00:19:42] expect to uh but uh that's a topic for
[00:19:46] another
[00:19:47] time now How likely are these
[00:19:50] predictions H well if you check out over
[00:19:53] here in the top right you will see our
[00:19:55] crypto predictions of 2024 and if you
[00:19:58] want to see how well they did you can
[00:20:00] watch this video over here in the top
[00:20:03] left that's me for now best wishes to
[00:20:05] you all for 20125 from all of us over
