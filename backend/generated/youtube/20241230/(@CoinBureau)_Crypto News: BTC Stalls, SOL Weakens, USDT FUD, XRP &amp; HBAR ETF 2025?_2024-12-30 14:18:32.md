## Market Analysis
### Current Market Conditions
The market sentiment is currently cautious, with Bitcoin and altcoins experiencing a lack of momentum. The end of the year is typically a period of low liquidity and reduced risk-taking among portfolio managers.

### Bitcoin Price Analysis
Bitcoin experienced a volatile week, dropping to a low of $93k before a mini Santa rally pushed it close to $100k. However, the lack of a sustained rally and the presence of bearish indicators suggest that BTC may remain range-bound in the short term.

### Altcoin ETFs and Regime Change at the SEC
With a new regime change at the SEC, altcoin ETFs could be the next to receive regulatory approval. Salana, XRP, and HBAR are potential candidates for ETF listings.

### Salana's Price Performance
Salana has experienced a drop in price recently, leading to concerns that it may have lost its momentum. However, when zooming out, Salana has had an impressive year and is still undervalued compared to its fundamentals.

### USDT Delisting in Europe
European exchanges are required to delist USDT due to new regulatory requirements. However, this has been known for some time, and Tether has been making preparations. USDC is a viable alternative stablecoin.

## Expert Opinion
Based on analysis and market conditions, BTC may continue to consolidate in the short term. The potential for altcoin ETFs and the continued growth of the crypto market provide opportunities for investors. However, regulatory concerns and market risks should be considered.

## Actionable Steps
1. Monitor BTC's price levels and key support/resistance areas.
2. Watch for developments in altcoin ETFs and consider potential investment opportunities.
3. Stay informed about regulatory changes and their impact on stablecoins like USDT.
