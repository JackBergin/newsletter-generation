[00:00:21] what's up with Bitcoin the center rally
[00:00:24] fails to materialize and BTC remains
[00:00:27] stuck in the '90s where might we be

[00:00:33] regime change coming to the SEC which
[00:00:35] alts could be next to get a coveted spot

[00:00:42] incredible 2024 has the sixth largest
[00:00:45] crypto run out of steam shut the fud up

[00:01:33] nice yeah family and everything down
[00:01:34] south yeah lovely yeah lovely well here
[00:01:37] we are back as Nick says the final live
[00:01:39] uh live newscast of 2025 we are almost
[00:01:42] there folks 2024 I should say I'm
[00:01:45] getting ahead of myself we're almost
[00:01:47] there um we didn't quite we got a mini
[00:01:49] Santa rally mini Santa rally mini me
[00:01:51] Santa rally yeah not the full delivery
[00:01:53] unfortunately he lost some of the gifts
[00:01:55] on his way yeah obviously some of you
[00:01:57] weren't good this year and so uh Center
[00:02:00] didn't come as expected this is this is
[00:02:02] entirely on you um okay so of course we
[00:02:05] will start off with a bit of Bitcoin
[00:02:06] price analysis uh what is BTC up to and
[00:02:09] what could lie ahead um Nick do you want
[00:02:11] to start us off with this indeed we I
[00:02:13] will now first of all to double check
[00:02:15] again um as Michael S the watching the
[00:02:17] stream because we know in the past five
[00:02:20] streams in a row he has marked the start
[00:02:22] of the stream with his Bitcoin Buys so
[00:02:25] uh last week he bought at about the
[00:02:27] first time above 100K at
[00:02:30] 6K um and I have reason to believe of
[00:02:33] course apart from the fact that he's
[00:02:34] watching The coino Weekly News live of
[00:02:37] course but that he would buy again
[00:02:39] because he pushed this tweet earlier or
[00:02:41] likely this evening which was basically
[00:02:43] uh disconcerting just go back to that it
[00:02:45] was disconcerting um disconcerting blue
[00:02:48] lines on Sailor tracker.com now
[00:02:50] obviously this those blue lines is the
[00:02:52] price of Bitcoin slightly below 100K
[00:02:55] which therefore implies he's probably
[00:02:56] thinking hey this could be a good buy
[00:02:58] now at lower than my previous Buy level
[00:03:00] so that could be incoming any moment now
[00:03:03] we shall see um let us know guys in the
[00:03:06] comments if it happens whilst the stream
[00:03:07] is live yes keep us posted we're relying
[00:03:09] we relying on you yeah um but of course
[00:03:12] last week was a very volatile week um so
[00:03:14] straight out of the news like on the
[00:03:16] Tuesday as we predicted like the prices
[00:03:18] did start falling and they hit a low of
[00:03:21] 93k which is the weekly low however um
[00:03:25] this mini Santella as we alluded to did
[00:03:27] come uh it started on their Christmas
[00:03:30] Eve and uh took us all the way on
[00:03:32] Christmas Day up to a high of about
[00:03:35] 999,000 almost breaking through that so
[00:03:38] close just so close yet so far yeah
[00:03:41] unfortunately um now what is happening
[00:03:44] well I think that there's just a general
[00:03:46] drisking of course in the end ofe
[00:03:48] markets you know portfolio managers
[00:03:49] usually they' have got their portfolio
[00:03:51] targets met in terms of returns it's a
[00:03:53] generally El liquid Market especially
[00:03:55] this time between Christmas and New
[00:03:56] Year's you don't want to take any risks
[00:03:58] by taking a position in Bitcoin or any
[00:04:00] sort of assets at this moment when
[00:04:02] you've hit met your targets and
[00:04:04] especially when there's no particular
[00:04:05] momentum right now uh as a result they
[00:04:08] haven't been taken positions and that's
[00:04:11] why uh I don't think there's General
[00:04:12] momentum being flowing uh but we also
[00:04:15] did see and further to that we did see
[00:04:17] black rocks ibit have its last largest
[00:04:20] day of outflows on uh just before
[00:04:22] Christmas day okay so that's 188 million
[00:04:25] out of black rocks IIT ETF right
[00:04:29] obviously that could impacted on prices
[00:04:30] on in that day what led to the fall
[00:04:32] right I think so yeah I think so few
[00:04:35] people drisking before the big day and
[00:04:37] really realizing some of their games
[00:04:38] remember some of these people bought
[00:04:40] these ETFs when they first launched they
[00:04:41] want to see realize some games Before
[00:04:43] Christmas maybe they want to go and buy
[00:04:44] some they've light late L the Christmas
[00:04:46] presents you know so yeah well can we go
[00:04:48] back to that previous chart that we were
[00:04:49] looking at where we had the uh the Santa
[00:04:52] rally is that Santa rally basically is
[00:04:54] that everyone who had failed or forgot
[00:04:57] to buy Christmas presents for people
[00:04:59] suddenly just gone oh oh God I'll get
[00:05:01] him some Bitcoin I'll get him some
[00:05:02] Bitcoin it's a good theory in hypothesis
[00:05:04] guy although that would that explain why
[00:05:06] I tanked afterwards my theory is
[00:05:07] potentially you give them Bitcoin and
[00:05:09] they're the kind of normies you don't
[00:05:10] give a [ __ ] about Bitcoin they're like
[00:05:11] what is this coin I'm going to and they
[00:05:13] were selling it progressively as after
[00:05:15] Christmas they got there you are look
[00:05:17] that's the Panic emergency Christmas Eve
[00:05:19] buys and then the uh the Christmas day
[00:05:22] like oh
[00:05:24] Bitcoin sell sell um so yeah I mean
[00:05:27] that's exactly what um uh uh is it did
[00:05:31] we just buy did micr just acquire we did
[00:05:33] okay there we go well done Michael well
[00:05:35] done on as always on Q as always there
[00:05:38] we go acquired
[00:05:40] 2,138 Bitcoin for $29 million at 97,000
[00:05:45] per 97 837 per Bitcoin see this is what
[00:05:48] you would not be able to do if it's not
[00:05:49] a live stream you know yeah there we go
[00:05:52] so he's done it Michael's done it um but
[00:05:54] uh yeah I mean there's just now there's
[00:05:57] also broader discussion now I think and
[00:06:00] part of the bearish you know tone is uh
[00:06:04] the likelihood of this Bitcoin strategic
[00:06:06] Reserve actually coming to pass yeah um
[00:06:09] now this is the chances on poly Market
[00:06:11] over there at 29% this is in the first
[00:06:13] 100 days to point out and it's important
[00:06:15] disclaimer but I still think that's a
[00:06:17] little bit High you think that's a bit
[00:06:19] generous generous yeah okay I think that
[00:06:22] um yeah because I think that first of
[00:06:24] all the chance it's a very a lot of lot
[00:06:26] of Hoops to go through right yeah to act
[00:06:28] actual this is the Strategic Reserve
[00:06:30] where they go out and buy the Cynthia
[00:06:32] lus one where they go out and accumulate
[00:06:34] up to a million Bitcoin right yeah um I
[00:06:38] think that's still a bit High because
[00:06:39] 100 days there's so much else going on
[00:06:41] and there are like I say many hurdles to
[00:06:43] jump through yeah yeah I don't think
[00:06:45] this is going to be a this would be a
[00:06:47] priority for Trump in in those first
[00:06:50] days weeks months as you say there's
[00:06:52] other stuff there's other stuff to do
[00:06:55] and it's kind of it's not an easy thing
[00:06:57] to do he would have to get Congressional
[00:06:59] approval for that the Republicans they
[00:07:00] have a majority in Congress but it's
[00:07:02] fairly slim and I think as uh Nick
[00:07:05] Carter and others have pointed out like
[00:07:07] there's no guarantee that all
[00:07:08] Republicans would necessarily vote the
[00:07:10] same way on this I think it's a fairly
[00:07:12] contentious issue um a Bitcoin strategic
[00:07:15] reserve and Trump kind of I think has an
[00:07:17] out because he can just choose to B do
[00:07:20] basically what he kind of alluded to in
[00:07:22] the first place which was just not to
[00:07:24] sell the BTC that the that the US
[00:07:26] government already holds which is a
[00:07:28] fairly sizable stack exactly that's kind
[00:07:30] of like what he alluded to exactly in
[00:07:31] the in the speech right so it's still
[00:07:33] relatively price positive but it's not
[00:07:35] as positive as many people were
[00:07:36] expecting to have this massive buys
[00:07:38] going into strategic reserve and it's
[00:07:41] not just us it's not just the poly
[00:07:43] Market odds but there's also um people
[00:07:44] including Nick Carter who's published
[00:07:46] something in the Bitcoin magazine yeah
[00:07:48] um about why not only he doesn't he
[00:07:50] think it's not going to happen but also
[00:07:52] why it's a bad idea um and we can leave
[00:07:54] a quote there which you guys can read um
[00:07:56] and then also Galaxy digital Alex Thor
[00:07:58] the head of firmwide research a Galaxy
[00:08:00] digital they released a a long list of
[00:08:02] predictions and one of them is that
[00:08:04] Bitcoin uh we got the Tweet here Bitcoin
[00:08:06] will not be bought by the US government
[00:08:07] in 2025 yeah um and although they will
[00:08:11] still hold the Bitcoin on hand um so
[00:08:14] there's this General kind of feeling
[00:08:16] that look maybe we got a bit ahead of
[00:08:17] ourselves and we were discussing earlier
[00:08:20] as well the chances are I think there's
[00:08:22] more what are there any surprise bullish
[00:08:24] Catalyst it's more likely that there's
[00:08:27] bearish bearish developments in the
[00:08:29] sense some of these bullish catalysts
[00:08:31] that were priced in yeah may not
[00:08:33] materialize and if maybe not as quickly
[00:08:36] as people had assumed yeah I think maybe
[00:08:39] the idea of a strategic Reserve has kind
[00:08:41] of got people huffing on the hopium a
[00:08:43] little too much and you know there's a
[00:08:46] sense I think maybe part of the reason
[00:08:48] why we're seeing this downturn at the
[00:08:50] moment is that starting to realize that
[00:08:52] we're maybe Running on Fumes a little
[00:08:53] bit and what we need to see is something
[00:08:56] concrete from trump it doesn't
[00:08:57] necessarily have to be the announcement
[00:08:59] of strategic reserve and like I you know
[00:09:01] I I think we're both in agreement with
[00:09:03] with Nick Carter and and Alex Thorne on
[00:09:05] this one that that's probably not going
[00:09:07] to happen but I think we need to see
[00:09:09] some positive action some positive words
[00:09:12] at least from Trump once he's
[00:09:13] inaugurated towards the end of January
[00:09:15] and I think I get the feeling that's
[00:09:17] kind of what the market is is waiting
[00:09:19] for at the moment the the sort of hopium
[00:09:21] on the Strategic Reserve is starting to
[00:09:23] that canister starting to run out
[00:09:25] exactly yeah um there was some other
[00:09:27] good news last week good and bad news I
[00:09:29] think good news internationally not just
[00:09:31] all about the US I we're always talking
[00:09:33] about the US here um but the Russian
[00:09:36] Russian Finance Minister confirmed that
[00:09:37] Bitcoin and crypto can be used for
[00:09:39] foreign trade so this is slightly
[00:09:41] bullish it shows that obviously
[00:09:42] countries are considering it and which
[00:09:44] is one of the predictions actually from
[00:09:45] our video yesterday is that more
[00:09:47] countries will use it for trade um but
[00:09:50] on bad on the bad news front
[00:09:52] unfortunately um despite the his name
[00:09:54] satosi did not manage to get the
[00:09:57] Japanese politician named satosi guys if
[00:09:59] you go back and watch the previous News
[00:10:00] live stream his name is satosi yeah he
[00:10:02] proposed this for the Japanese
[00:10:04] Parliament and uh that has unfortunately
[00:10:06] failed yeah um it's a shame that but
[00:10:09] like just the fact that this is being
[00:10:10] talked about and again I think maybe
[00:10:12] this is what we maybe we need to look at
[00:10:14] the positives you know rather than the
[00:10:15] kind of negatives of oh no this isn't
[00:10:17] going to happen the positive side of it
[00:10:19] is that this is being talked about this
[00:10:21] is being talked about seriously this
[00:10:22] isn't like you know this isn't some
[00:10:24] bitcoiner who's the discussion yeah yeah
[00:10:26] who's just kind of getting way too
[00:10:28] window has been moved right it takes
[00:10:30] some time um now when it comes to where
[00:10:33] are we going um now I will again refer
[00:10:35] you of course to our prot Traders at the
[00:10:37] coin Bureau trading Channel which is
[00:10:39] right over here you guys can scan that
[00:10:41] QR code yesterday mariona released a a
[00:10:44] video which is really interesting and
[00:10:46] it's basically I'm buying and obviously
[00:10:48] the video of the premise is obviously
[00:10:49] things are looking bearish on the charts
[00:10:51] a lot of people are bearish um
[00:10:53] especially in the influencer side and
[00:10:54] then also many of the charts are bearish
[00:10:56] but he's going to place it contrarian
[00:10:58] swing trade and you know I I would of
[00:11:00] course encourage you guys to watch the
[00:11:01] video so you can uh see for yourself but
[00:11:04] one of the charts for instance I asked
[00:11:05] them to share with me for one is this
[00:11:07] bearish head and shoulders pattern right
[00:11:09] so it could potentially according to
[00:11:11] this obviously we should be seeing a
[00:11:12] breakdown to lower levels the central
[00:11:14] pivot Central pivot ranges but Mariano
[00:11:16] has placed he thinks of two potential
[00:11:18] alternative scenarios where he's placed
[00:11:20] his swing trade um there at about the
[00:11:22] 93k level he's thought about ideas there
[00:11:25] and those the potential scenarios he
[00:11:27] sees BT Bitcoin going but of of course
[00:11:29] there are more bearish charts out there
[00:11:31] of course including a weak monthly
[00:11:33] candle close the monthly candle closed
[00:11:35] very weekly we had a breakdown on the
[00:11:38] RSI as well which is a separate chart
[00:11:40] here as well and then of course ongoing
[00:11:42] distribution patterns are also quite
[00:11:44] bearish um and then of course we've got
[00:11:46] liquidity levels from this trading
[00:11:47] different uh software which basically
[00:11:50] shows the liquidation levels where a lot
[00:11:52] of liquidity is placed um according to
[00:11:54] different time frames and um around the
[00:11:56] 88 to 87K level we've got quite a bit of
[00:11:59] liquidity potentially either you know
[00:12:01] stop losses for the Longs or potential
[00:12:04] buys for those who want to get long so
[00:12:07] um so we could be looking to bounce off
[00:12:08] that we could be looking to bounce off
[00:12:09] that we could be looking to market
[00:12:10] makers that generally the view is that
[00:12:12] the con thesis is that these liquidation
[00:12:15] levels act as kind of magnets for the
[00:12:17] price so we could potentially see
[00:12:18] Bitcoin going there in the short term um
[00:12:21] but marianao has I said he's like
[00:12:23] potentially placed the and he's also
[00:12:24] said it's important if you don't have
[00:12:26] Alpha if the consensus is the market in
[00:12:29] one way and you take the view of the
[00:12:30] market right generally in trading as an
[00:12:32] invest in the contrarian trades can do
[00:12:34] quite well he does have one interesting
[00:12:36] chart which is the CME Gap now for the
[00:12:39] for Traders out there obviously the CME
[00:12:41] Gap is the difference between the CME
[00:12:43] close when it you know opens and closes
[00:12:45] off at a price that may be different
[00:12:46] because Bitcoin is trading 247 where the
[00:12:48] CME only over business hours um and
[00:12:52] there was a gap before Christmas at
[00:12:54] about 99k and about 60% of the time the
[00:12:57] thesis's Traders say the Gap is closed
[00:13:00] um so there's potential yes but that's
[00:13:02] 60% of the that's only 60% of the time
[00:13:04] it doesn't always get closed so but
[00:13:06] that's part of the the analysis that fed
[00:13:08] into his thesis but again I will refer
[00:13:11] you guys of course to uh subscribe to
[00:13:13] the Quan Bureau trading and watch that
[00:13:15] video to get your the full analysis
[00:13:16] itself we hope that maybe we can get to
[00:13:18] 50K on the channel the coin Bureau
[00:13:20] training channel before the end of the
[00:13:22] year absolutely major Milestone so if we
[00:13:24] get to 50K subscribers by the end of the
[00:13:26] year Nick has promised to wear trousers
[00:13:28] for every sub qu live for 202 I know
[00:13:31] what I heard I know what I heard I know
[00:13:33] what I heard everyone else in the room
[00:13:34] here true so there is the guest I'm G to
[00:13:37] delete that trading
[00:13:38] Channel I cannot subject myself to that
[00:13:42] that's a step too much man step too much
[00:13:44] okay okay well uh well test it out
[00:13:46] anyway um yeah coin Bureau trading lots
[00:13:48] of lots of great Alpha there okay so it
[00:13:50] looks like then Bitcoin unless unless
[00:13:53] the whales step in unless sailor really
[00:13:55] decides to pump the market um big time
[00:13:58] it looks like uh BTC is going to finish
[00:14:00] the year on a little bit of a flat note
[00:14:02] but flat or bearish yeah yeah a little
[00:14:03] bit of a bearish note but um I think
[00:14:06] that would you know that would kind of
[00:14:07] do a lot of disservice to the sort of
[00:14:10] you know astonishing 12 months that
[00:14:12] Bitcoin and you know most of the rest of
[00:14:14] the crypto Market has seen tell anybody
[00:14:16] about four months ago that Bitcoin would
[00:14:18] be at 93k and would be debating the
[00:14:20] nuances of oh no 93k it's we looking bit
[00:14:24] bearish now come on guys bet take the
[00:14:26] wins take the wins if you told that to
[00:14:28] anyone in crypto You' be oh you know by
[00:14:30] uh by by the end of the year we'd be at
[00:14:31] 93k I bet you anyone who'd been in
[00:14:33] crypto for a while would have gone yes
[00:14:35] and everyone's moaning about the fact
[00:14:37] that we're not at 100K in the world in
[00:14:38] Tradition man in Tradition as always so
[00:14:42] uh yeah although we're down a little bit
[00:14:44] um next year is looking very very
[00:14:46] interesting indeed and of course one of
[00:14:48] the big bullish catalysts that could
[00:14:50] come next year um is obviously because
[00:14:53] of regime change that is going to happen
[00:14:55] at the SEC uh Gary gendler out Paul
[00:14:58] Atkins in
[00:14:59] um the possibility of further crypto
[00:15:03] spot crypto ETFs is becoming more and
[00:15:06] more likely um so obviously 2024 was the
[00:15:09] year of the spot Bitcoin ETFs that's
[00:15:11] what began this whole runup then we had
[00:15:13] the spot ethereum ETFs approved it's a
[00:15:15] little bit out of the blue speculation
[00:15:17] then turned to what was coming next what
[00:15:20] would be the next crypto to get a spot
[00:15:22] ETF in the United States and there are a
[00:15:25] lot of names in the frame first it was
[00:15:27] just Soul really wasn't it everyone was
[00:15:28] talking about oh salana will be next um
[00:15:31] but it looks like we could have a whole
[00:15:33] load of altcoin ETFs coming down the
[00:15:36] pipe uh some some kind of um predictable
[00:15:39] names in there some slightly less
[00:15:42] predictable now you've just done a video
[00:15:43] on this Nick which is which which we're
[00:15:45] going to release soon so I want you to
[00:15:47] give us the lowdown what ETFs what give
[00:15:49] us some give us some hopium ETFs hopium
[00:15:52] Alpha uh okay well for one I mean this
[00:15:54] is probably not a very groundbreaking
[00:15:56] one it's a combined Bitcoin and ethereum
[00:15:59] ETF which is not amazing but it was
[00:16:02] approved now uh one recently two by
[00:16:04] Franklin Templeton and hash deex um it
[00:16:07] was expected now this is also there's
[00:16:09] one more approval waiting that could be
[00:16:11] the first approval in 2025 now as the
[00:16:14] name would suggest it's a combined ETF
[00:16:17] with Bitcoin and ethereum which I kind
[00:16:19] of think is a really silly product I
[00:16:21] mean to be honest if I'm an investor I I
[00:16:24] would buy Bitcoin ethereum and ethereum
[00:16:25] eum and if I wanted by exposure to both
[00:16:28] I would do it then in a way that I could
[00:16:30] choose the amount I want in my portfolio
[00:16:32] right you know size it accordingly yeah
[00:16:35] whereas yeah I assume it's probably like
[00:16:37] equal exposure just I just don't it
[00:16:39] wouldn't I wouldn't personally but you
[00:16:41] know they've they've applied for it it's
[00:16:42] got approved and it's was a pretty
[00:16:44] simple approval because there's already
[00:16:46] exists Bitcoin and ethereum ETFs so yeah
[00:16:49] I'm not sure but yeah I don't I don't
[00:16:51] necessarily see the the the case for
[00:16:53] this why what what the demand would be
[00:16:56] for this I don't think yeah I mean I
[00:16:58] guess it's probably just an additional
[00:16:59] product on the shells for these
[00:17:01] investors um but another one which is
[00:17:03] really interesting and one in fact that
[00:17:05] I think many of the analysts including
[00:17:07] the Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric balunas
[00:17:09] and James saford who think is the most
[00:17:12] likely next one is Litecoin um now I
[00:17:16] don't I bet you didn't have that on your
[00:17:18] hang on wait wait a minute wait a minute
[00:17:19] I remember Litecoin Litecoin yeah I
[00:17:22] remember L back in those year 2018 you
[00:17:24] know the silver coin yeah you know
[00:17:26] Charlie light you know that kind of
[00:17:29] stuff yeah okay back in the days man
[00:17:31] that OG coin um yeah but they
[00:17:34] potentially think this could be the next
[00:17:35] uh ETF likecoin ETF and that's for two
[00:17:38] very good reasons I think one because of
[00:17:40] its longevity it's been around for a
[00:17:41] very long time so that's proof of you
[00:17:44] know they can track the data check out
[00:17:45] market conditions all that kind of stuff
[00:17:47] but also because it's a fork of Bitcoin
[00:17:50] yeah and of course there's the questions
[00:17:51] around decentralization that kind of
[00:17:53] stuff so I think that um Litecoin is
[00:17:56] Litecoin is the next potential ETF and
[00:17:59] then one that's even more of a surprise
[00:18:02] than Litecoin and that the ETF analysts
[00:18:04] themselves have pointed to as
[00:18:05] potentially being a early approval is oh
[00:18:08] one more thing of course Litecoin hasn't
[00:18:10] been it's been termed a a commodity by
[00:18:12] the cftc that's right my third Point as
[00:18:14] well now coming back to my point the
[00:18:16] third one which may not be on everyone's
[00:18:18] radar is hadera's H bar okay right so
[00:18:24] yeah position for a 2025 ETF due to its
[00:18:27] on gr um grow adoption and unique
[00:18:29] Network architecture so it's really
[00:18:32] interesting that's that don't know H bar
[00:18:34] as well I think has has managed to avoid
[00:18:37] the security designation I don't think
[00:18:39] anyone not even not even um the Fanatics
[00:18:42] at Gary gz's SEC have uh have tried to
[00:18:44] label H bar security yeah so it's kind
[00:18:46] of like missed the fire you know missed
[00:18:48] the it's been managed to dodge all those
[00:18:49] landmines yeah and get off the radar not
[00:18:52] be on the radar of the SEC maybe that's
[00:18:53] because of all the Partnerships they've
[00:18:55] got with all those large you know
[00:18:58] Enterprises
[00:18:59] yeah gosh it's funny though isn't it
[00:19:01] because like you know I one of the one
[00:19:03] of the reasons why um why Saul I think
[00:19:06] was was being talked about for uh you
[00:19:08] know for for an ETF earlier in the year
[00:19:10] was because it was commanding so much
[00:19:12] mind share and things like Litecoin
[00:19:14] hyera xrp which I think we're going to
[00:19:16] talk about in A Moment Like These
[00:19:18] weren't really getting much attention
[00:19:20] and then suddenly in the last few weeks
[00:19:22] we've had this kind of if you like Dino
[00:19:24] coin rally and suddenly people are
[00:19:26] talking about some of these some of
[00:19:28] these crypto shows that had dropped off
[00:19:29] the radar of a lot of of a lot of us um
[00:19:32] you know who've been in the space for a
[00:19:33] while yeah 100% um and speaking of xrp
[00:19:37] yeah xrp uh and salana are both expected
[00:19:40] xrp is expected later in 2025 okay and
[00:19:44] this they say potentially is due to
[00:19:45] regulatory complexities of course it is
[00:19:47] still despite the fact that Gary Gensler
[00:19:49] is moving on to better uh greener
[00:19:52] pastures the I think um that uh still
[00:19:55] there's the the lawsuit is still there
[00:19:57] so you know that's an going to be a
[00:19:59] potential drag unless it's you know just
[00:20:02] revoked or dropped um but then of course
[00:20:05] Soul um now it hasn't um it although
[00:20:09] there has been there was a lawsuit that
[00:20:10] accused that they tried to label Soul as
[00:20:12] of security that has been dropped
[00:20:14] however there is still it doesn't have
[00:20:16] the clarity that Litecoin yeah Bitcoin
[00:20:19] Etc have had in terms of being a
[00:20:21] commodity or not a security um but there
[00:20:24] are a lot of applications I think
[00:20:25] there's at least three or four for xrp
[00:20:28] and was well as salana you've got like
[00:20:29] bitwise 21 shares
[00:20:32] um think Wisdom Tree quite a few of the
[00:20:35] top providers have applied for soul and
[00:20:38] and been rejected I think in a few Cas
[00:20:40] rejected Soul two Soul have been
[00:20:42] rejected so they said which is you know
[00:20:44] Gary against is probably his parting
[00:20:46] Parting
[00:20:47] Gift like yeah what he want his final go
[00:20:51] send off um but there is actually what's
[00:20:53] interesting here and this it feeds into
[00:20:55] that is that yesterday saw the news that
[00:20:59] volatility shares filed for a salana
[00:21:02] Futures ETF right now this is
[00:21:04] interesting
[00:21:06] because yeah yeah I mean this is kind of
[00:21:08] this is this is sort of what what is the
[00:21:10] accepted kind of First Step isn't it
[00:21:12] exactly but also because there are no so
[00:21:14] CME red Futures products right yeah so
[00:21:17] basically that means that because there
[00:21:18] are no s c the the future ctfs obviously
[00:21:21] buy Futures instead of spot there are no
[00:21:23] soulle Futures ETFs I mean soulle
[00:21:25] Futures on the CME which means that
[00:21:27] volatility shares at least thinks that
[00:21:29] uh we could be seeing salana listed
[00:21:32] Futures on the CME and that's important
[00:21:34] because CME listed Futures are one of
[00:21:36] the requirements at least from a market
[00:21:37] intelligence perspective for the SEC to
[00:21:39] be comfortable with spot
[00:21:42] ETFs um okay yeah okay so yeah I mean it
[00:21:47] looks like this is going to be well
[00:21:48] before we before we uh sort of round
[00:21:50] this off I should say that there's
[00:21:51] another category of coins being talked
[00:21:54] now this was this was not on my bingo
[00:21:56] card either um we could actually see
[00:22:00] some dogcoin ETFs next year right these
[00:22:03] are these are being talked about they
[00:22:05] talked about yeah uh so Nate gachi who's
[00:22:08] the president of the ETF store um was
[00:22:11] was expressing surprise that no ETF
[00:22:13] issuer has filed for a Dogecoin ETF yeah
[00:22:16] I mean there's supposedly a minimal
[00:22:18] downside risk I mean the fact that it is
[00:22:20] quite decentralized I've seen quite a
[00:22:22] few supect a little quite a little
[00:22:23] speculation that Doge could be an ETF
[00:22:26] candidate what I was not seen as an ETF
[00:22:28] candidate
[00:22:30] though is last week there was the cftc
[00:22:34] classification that dog coins including
[00:22:36] flocky is a quote utility token which
[00:22:40] therefore drove it into Arbor Drive and
[00:22:41] all that um and I I don't know why he
[00:22:44] ref why this head of global markets
[00:22:46] advisory committee decided to label
[00:22:48] flocky as the dis chosen utility dogcoin
[00:22:51] of choice but that obviously drove
[00:22:52] flocky into overdrive and as a result
[00:22:55] flocky da last week actually voted on a
[00:22:57] proposal to provide liquidity for a
[00:23:00] European flocky
[00:23:02] ETP wow okay so we could get a flocky
[00:23:06] ETP ETF this is what I this is one of
[00:23:09] the things I love about crypto is that
[00:23:11] you try to you try to second guess it
[00:23:13] you know you try to think okay what's a
[00:23:15] what's a contrarian play here like
[00:23:17] everyone's talking about an xrp ETF or a
[00:23:20] Sol ETF what's a contrarian play on that
[00:23:22] I tell you what a Dogecoin ETF that's an
[00:23:24] old school crypto it's proof of work you
[00:23:26] know maybe that it's not a security
[00:23:28] maybe that could be the next ETF and
[00:23:30] then crypto goes no no that's not
[00:23:32] contrarian enough that's not cont blocky
[00:23:35] I'm going to talk about a a flaky a
[00:23:37] flaky enu ETF this is this remember the
[00:23:39] meme coin that is named after Elon
[00:23:41] musk's dog and is also apparently of
[00:23:43] Viking law okay a flocky is a viking
[00:23:46] apparently so the dog is named after a
[00:23:48] viking and the mean coin is named after
[00:23:51] the dog yeah and it could be getting an
[00:23:52] ETF exactly welcome to cryp what a world
[00:23:56] um but we have quickly before we jump
[00:23:57] onto the next topic I think obviously
[00:23:59] everyone wants to know and you know any
[00:24:01] price predictions price predictions
[00:24:02] obviously uh now OB generally ETFs do
[00:24:06] have a positive impact on the price we
[00:24:08] saw it with Bitcoin of course we didn't
[00:24:09] see it with another cryptocurrency which
[00:24:12] shall remain namless they got spot ETFs
[00:24:15] this year it's had a tough enough year
[00:24:17] tough but um so some of these
[00:24:18] predictions sold predictions they range
[00:24:19] from about $300 to $450 with others
[00:24:22] predicting up to $1,000 so you know
[00:24:25] which I could see that I could totally
[00:24:26] see that yeah yeah s RP $280 to $315 in
[00:24:30] the near term um with longer term price
[00:24:33] predictions of $10 so wow you know all
[00:24:37] those people calling for a $10 xrp on uh
[00:24:40] on YouTube and elsewhere they could be
[00:24:42] right they could be right I wouldn't I
[00:24:44] wouldn't doubt the xrp Army one thing I
[00:24:47] would slightly doubt I mean LTC they've
[00:24:49] got a range here in the near term of 1,
[00:24:51] 130 to
[00:24:53] $160 with some predictions of people who
[00:24:56] potentially on crack to a,
[00:25:00] $2,000 yeah but these the guys also
[00:25:03] these not a buy predictions these are
[00:25:04] the consensus Market predictions so you
[00:25:07] know okay and finally H bar potentially
[00:25:09] between 70 cents to 80 cents in the long
[00:25:11] term so on the slightly more
[00:25:12] conservative front there yeah it was odd
[00:25:15] that kind of with the speculation around
[00:25:16] the harar ETF it didn't seem to really
[00:25:19] har bar itself didn't really seem to
[00:25:21] move much I mean maybe it's just seen I
[00:25:23] think it's seen a lot of gains already
[00:25:24] right yeah pump sort of ran out of steam
[00:25:27] okay let's bring up before we uh before
[00:25:29] we move on to the next subject let's
[00:25:30] bring up this week's Wall of Shame uh so
[00:25:34] this is the list of countries with the
[00:25:35] fewest Oh my Jesus that's something that
[00:25:37] can't be unseen uh the list of
[00:25:39] countries's territories I should say
[00:25:41] with the fewest viewers of last week's
[00:25:43] Live Life of Brian sorry it does look
[00:25:46] quite Life of Brian doesn't
[00:25:48] it um okay so the Isle of Man that's
[00:25:52] interesting too busy too busy counting
[00:25:54] their taxfree gains over on the is man
[00:25:57] um Plus it's not a particularly big
[00:25:59] place so uh maybe maybe that explains it
[00:26:02] the Bahamas another Caribbean country
[00:26:04] last week what two weeks ago was bom
[00:26:06] right no not Barbados yeah Caribbean's
[00:26:09] been underperforming we're watching you
[00:26:11] we're watching you even if you're not
[00:26:12] watching us um Panama uh maybe they're
[00:26:15] just too busy uh worrying about the
[00:26:16] canal oh that is true worrying about the
[00:26:18] canal all C in taxfree games because
[00:26:21] obviously that's what they share with
[00:26:22] the olive man yeah I'm seeing a pattern
[00:26:24] emerging here and uh last but not least
[00:26:26] Montenegro which has a banger of a flag
[00:26:29] it does that is a cool flag yeah yeah
[00:26:32] that's well okay all right Montenegro
[00:26:34] we'll let you off for having a cool flag
[00:26:36] but don't let it happen again um so that
[00:26:39] was uh that was this week's Wall of
[00:26:40] Shame now let's move on so we were
[00:26:42] talking earlier about the possibilities
[00:26:44] of uh salana ETF and I think this is the
[00:26:47] ideal time to talk a bit more about
[00:26:49] salana in general because it has had
[00:26:52] like Bitcoin and many other cryptos a
[00:26:54] stellar 2024 but also seems to be ending
[00:26:57] on a bit of a flat note so we thought
[00:27:00] we'd kind of dig into this a little bit
[00:27:01] see what's going up with what's going on
[00:27:03] with salul you know why why has the
[00:27:05] price remained flat why is it being
[00:27:06] outperformed by a lot of other cryptos
[00:27:09] and is this a case of you know the rally
[00:27:12] running out of steam or are there more
[00:27:13] deep rooted problems do some soul
[00:27:15] searching
[00:27:17] oh you come for you come for the
[00:27:20] analysis you stay the for the god awful
[00:27:24] puns yes Nick let's do some soul search
[00:27:27] soul searching um Okay cool so basically
[00:27:30] well yeah over the past month I think or
[00:27:32] past two months since Trump was elected
[00:27:33] I think it was important like Soul has
[00:27:35] been underperforming some of the other
[00:27:37] coins in a category um so for example
[00:27:39] eth Soul performance we've got that yeah
[00:27:41] eth has been outperforming Soul um so
[00:27:44] much too much relief the relief of the
[00:27:45] eth Maxis um obviously soul soul has
[00:27:49] also be been underperforming suie so you
[00:27:51] can see the sui Soul there you see su's
[00:27:53] been obviously all one with the move
[00:27:56] narrative and even more recent like
[00:27:58] projects that are focused on this um you
[00:28:00] know this is hype hype versus soul and
[00:28:04] hype has been outperforming um and so
[00:28:07] that's price performance obviously U
[00:28:09] last seven days we've also seen a drop
[00:28:11] off in activity on uh volumes for so
[00:28:15] salana compared to uh a lot of the other
[00:28:17] um layer ones and smart contract
[00:28:20] cryptocurrencies and funding rates on
[00:28:22] the pers markets have also been
[00:28:24] relatively low compared to where they
[00:28:25] were just in early December obviously
[00:28:27] this is the cost of Longs take open long
[00:28:30] positions there less demand for that
[00:28:32] compared to to the shorts so um there is
[00:28:35] this General sense of like you know
[00:28:37] stuck in a Range um there's also been
[00:28:39] some news headlines that have been a bit
[00:28:42] bearish like they've talked about market
[00:28:43] cap slips M bearish
[00:28:45] December yeah and there's all scores
[00:28:47] this overhang of the unlocks right yeah
[00:28:49] I think that's I mean just going back to
[00:28:51] that previous one that the market capsul
[00:28:53] I mean I think that's strikes me as a
[00:28:56] little bit unfair that story CU it's
[00:28:58] sort of like it's sort of singling out
[00:28:59] salana it's like yeah the whole Market
[00:29:01] dipped after the fomc it's sort of like
[00:29:03] you know everyone took a everyone took a
[00:29:05] dip yeah um but uh yeah I mean they've
[00:29:08] still they've still got a point in that
[00:29:09] salon's been a tough one sorry guys so
[00:29:11] if we skip back to uh skip back to those
[00:29:13] unlocks um yeah I mean it's it's been a
[00:29:16] while since we were last able to FUD
[00:29:17] salana with an unlock narrative wasn't
[00:29:19] it yeah to be yeah and it is one that
[00:29:21] but I think that to look to be honest
[00:29:22] it's it's not a it's not a big unlock
[00:29:24] it's 2.3% of the outstanding Supply not
[00:29:26] massive and also this question of the
[00:29:28] term bullish unlocks right from the
[00:29:31] concept of the so FTX the locked Soul
[00:29:34] FTX allocations was one of the some of
[00:29:37] the most widely traded OTC which
[00:29:39] therefore means that the most the people
[00:29:41] who are most likely buying it were
[00:29:43] long-term bullish Soul funds hedge funds
[00:29:46] investors if that for instance was still
[00:29:49] held at FTX and they couldn't have sold
[00:29:51] at the moment that Stuff unlocks they
[00:29:52] would have dumped it because the FTX
[00:29:53] wants to sell right to be able to pay
[00:29:55] back the debtors um um but basically in
[00:29:59] this case the creditors in this case
[00:30:01] basically um it's been sold to people
[00:30:03] who potentially want to be long sold so
[00:30:05] it's it's this concept that it's been
[00:30:06] given over to investors who not looking
[00:30:08] to dump tokens when it's unlocked they
[00:30:11] looking to as a long-term play so I
[00:30:13] would take the counter argument there
[00:30:14] and so actually um it's going to have no
[00:30:16] impact and it's always this case where
[00:30:18] the The Narrative of oh there's an
[00:30:20] unlock coming oh there's an unlock
[00:30:21] coming causes more of the price
[00:30:23] depreciation than the actual unlocks
[00:30:25] themselves so I think that that's bit of
[00:30:27] a f there um and there was um speaking
[00:30:31] of there was a interesting glass node
[00:30:32] report from last week on salana um and I
[00:30:36] think it's important to point out that
[00:30:38] it's winning D zoom out like salana has
[00:30:40] done incredibly well over the year I
[00:30:42] mean let's just for instance since
[00:30:44] November 2022 salana has outperformed
[00:30:46] BTC and eth on 344 of 727 of the trading
[00:30:51] days and you can see its relative
[00:30:53] performance there that's pretty that's
[00:30:55] pretty strong yeah it's pretty strong
[00:30:57] and there's just general Capital inflows
[00:30:58] going into salana as well we can see
[00:31:00] this with the net realized profit to
[00:31:02] loss which basically measures um the
[00:31:04] profits that Co since coins have been
[00:31:06] moved according to the realized cap and
[00:31:09] it shows that there's been a net capital
[00:31:10] flow since January of this year um as
[00:31:13] opposed to previous outflows and um
[00:31:16] another interesting chart is this mvrv
[00:31:19] chart so this is the market value to
[00:31:20] realized value which basically measures
[00:31:22] yeah the mark the market cap to the
[00:31:24] realized value which is the price the
[00:31:25] last coins were moved cumulatively and
[00:31:27] they kind of gives a sense kind of like
[00:31:28] a price to book in a stock like a
[00:31:30] valuation compared to some fundamental
[00:31:32] Nar value and the the bands are
[00:31:35] basically the standard deviations to
[00:31:36] show how far or they are the from the
[00:31:40] mean the price right and we still quite
[00:31:42] far from the two one standard dation
[00:31:44] which means that we know when near
[00:31:46] overvalued from a fundamental
[00:31:48] perspective okay so salana is still
[00:31:50] looking not looking anywhere near to
[00:31:52] overvalued compared to these fundamental
[00:31:54] factors okay now then on the kind of you
[00:31:57] know on the flip side of that sort of
[00:31:58] you know the kind of bearish sentiment
[00:32:00] around sa itself you have a look at the
[00:32:02] Salan ecosystem um and I mean the daps
[00:32:05] there have been have been growing like
[00:32:06] crazy they have indeed so this is a
[00:32:08] report um that shows how much of the DAP
[00:32:10] revenues have grown since the beginning
[00:32:12] of the year and that's why I say when in
[00:32:14] doubt zoom out look at that the growth
[00:32:16] yeah both in salana Deb revenue and in
[00:32:18] salana protocol Revenue um there is one
[00:32:21] point though that a lot of these dabs
[00:32:22] from the same report
[00:32:26] are when never whenever on salana comes
[00:32:29] to mind it's is only one thing you can
[00:32:31] really think of coins and surprisingly
[00:32:33] terram Bots as well that surprised me
[00:32:35] yeah because obviously you know pump.
[00:32:37] fun has has taken up so much mind share
[00:32:40] over feels like the whole year but it's
[00:32:41] only really been the last few months but
[00:32:43] actually telegram Bots was a big thing
[00:32:45] at the start of the year yeah and sort
[00:32:47] of like now seem to have fizzled out but
[00:32:50] it's it's interesting to see that
[00:32:51] reflected so strongly in the uh in the
[00:32:53] chart I'm also kind of surprised not to
[00:32:56] see any deep in there because you know
[00:32:58] salano is I think very you know trying
[00:33:00] to position itself as a deep in chain
[00:33:02] obviously projects like helium um you
[00:33:04] know kind of real blue chips in that
[00:33:05] regard I think there's just so little de
[00:33:07] Revenue taking place in these deepend
[00:33:08] products to be honest reach to even land
[00:33:11] on that Spectrum yeah um so a big thing
[00:33:14] for salana in 2025 I think is probably
[00:33:17] going to be in try to try to move past
[00:33:19] this whole memes thing it's like yes
[00:33:21] this is a this is a case for the chain
[00:33:23] you know this is a this has been great
[00:33:24] for salana in many many ways but I think
[00:33:27] probably
[00:33:28] you know they want to move beyond that
[00:33:29] yeah let's move Beyond it let's go to
[00:33:31] actual 30 projects building things um
[00:33:33] and you know that's why we'd like it'd
[00:33:35] be cool to see the spot deck as R
[00:33:37] Revenue picking up in the next year
[00:33:39] let's see yeah yeah um meanwhile tvl on
[00:33:42] salana is is is still only going in One
[00:33:45] Direction so that's good yeah that's
[00:33:46] great and um AI xbt is also a fan this
[00:33:50] is my new favorite Twitter account if
[00:33:51] you've been tuning in for the last few
[00:33:53] live streams you'll be familiar with
[00:33:54] this it's just I almost said he it's
[00:33:58] just changed its profile pick did you
[00:34:00] assume its gender uh no
[00:34:03] comment
[00:34:06] they um just changed their profile pick
[00:34:10] uh yes um Soul just captured 53% of
[00:34:12] global L1 Fe with $431 million Revenue
[00:34:16] in 30 days processing more transactions
[00:34:18] than all other chains combined yeah so I
[00:34:21] think that's a good I think that's a
[00:34:22] good kind of note to end on and you know
[00:34:24] end the salon section of this on I kind
[00:34:27] of feel like again this is such a this
[00:34:29] is a thing you really see a lot in
[00:34:30] crypto something goes up and it goes up
[00:34:33] and up and up and you know it does
[00:34:34] really well and then it stops going up
[00:34:37] for whatever reason and people kind of
[00:34:39] lose their minds a bit and go this is
[00:34:40] the end what's happening what's wrong
[00:34:42] it's like you know this this could be
[00:34:45] just a consolidation phase this could
[00:34:46] just doubt zoom out guys when in doubt
[00:34:48] zoom out exactly so yeah uh there's a
[00:34:51] lot happening with salana I think um I I
[00:34:54] I you'd be a brave brave person to fade
[00:34:57] it 2025 I think unnecessary but speaking
[00:35:01] of which on to our next story beautiful
[00:35:04] here we go okay yeah uh this is uh this
[00:35:06] is it wouldn't it just wouldn't be a
[00:35:08] year in crypto without some tether fud
[00:35:11] and as it draws to a close that is what
[00:35:13] we've got so I've seen a lot of people
[00:35:15] getting their knickers really in a Twist
[00:35:18] about this um so this is the news I mean
[00:35:21] it's not even news because we've known
[00:35:23] this for quite a long time but from
[00:35:25] today uh European exchanges are required
[00:35:28] to begin delisting tether's usdt and
[00:35:31] this is because of the eu's Micah
[00:35:35] regulations uh which um were drafted
[00:35:37] quite some time ago are now coming into
[00:35:39] Force um and you know this has because
[00:35:43] this date has been reached the 30th of
[00:35:45] December this has kicked off a wave of
[00:35:47] fud um you know the tether fuds crawling
[00:35:49] out from under the woodwork again um and
[00:35:52] uh we've got a couple here a couple of
[00:35:54] tweets here coming out to the bwork
[00:35:56] exactly um this one uh T hasn't beened
[00:36:00] anything in over two week oh gosh okay
[00:36:02] um and then another one from uh Justin
[00:36:05] bonds um uh bigger than FTX and Bernie
[00:36:08] madeof yeah how about that um so yeah I
[00:36:12] think the first thing to point out about
[00:36:14] this is that European exchanges have
[00:36:16] known for quite some time that this D
[00:36:19] listing uh is coming um there's also a
[00:36:22] fair amount of runway in fact as I'm as
[00:36:24] far as I'm aware they don't actually
[00:36:27] have to delist it until 2026 yeah
[00:36:30] exactly there's a lot of time and I
[00:36:31] think that uh yeah I mean and the fact
[00:36:33] that it has been preparing for it we've
[00:36:35] known about it for a long time right and
[00:36:37] it's like I don't know why all of a
[00:36:38] sudden it just comes to this particular
[00:36:39] point I think it's engagement farming
[00:36:41] yeah um coinbase recently we're we're on
[00:36:45] uh we're doing this um delisting usdt I
[00:36:48] believe uh okx did so fairly recently as
[00:36:51] well um and I think really the story
[00:36:54] here rather than you know rather than oh
[00:36:57] this is terrible for tether you know is
[00:36:59] this the end blah blah blah this is more
[00:37:01] a story I think about European
[00:37:04] regulation Europe's talent for seemingly
[00:37:07] nothing but regulation when it comes to
[00:37:09] Tech the the people who are really going
[00:37:11] to lose out here are going to be crypto
[00:37:13] users in the EU because they're going to
[00:37:14] see liquidity not disappear but uh be
[00:37:18] significantly reduced they're going to
[00:37:20] have fewer trading pairs the rest of
[00:37:22] Europe the rest of the world innovates
[00:37:24] Europe regulates I mean it's ridiculous
[00:37:26] because think about it like I mean so
[00:37:28] for for one yeah you're reducing
[00:37:29] liquidity less liquidity means more more
[00:37:32] expensive because you're going to have
[00:37:33] to pay at higher prices market makers
[00:37:35] not going to have to utilize you have to
[00:37:36] go with either the Euro pairs you have
[00:37:38] to go with stable coins Euro stable
[00:37:40] coins um and you know there's been
[00:37:42] statements for instance one of these
[00:37:43] guys on Bloomberg he said I understand
[00:37:45] why it's been done to a certain extent
[00:37:47] but it's quite exclusionary and quite
[00:37:49] limiting for EU clients themselves
[00:37:51] because usdt is the most liquid stable
[00:37:54] coin by a country mile and we actually
[00:37:57] also have a nice quote from within the
[00:37:59] article um you know so it's just it's
[00:38:02] just I don't know if we can pull that up
[00:38:03] against this backdrop the RIS that
[00:38:05] Europe will become a crypto
[00:38:07] Backwater I think that's a that's a
[00:38:09] genuine risk venture capital investment
[00:38:11] in crypto startups in Europe for example
[00:38:13] is pois to drop for to a four-year low
[00:38:15] in 2024 so yeah yeah it's just it's just
[00:38:18] crazy and it is it is true um but
[00:38:21] nonetheless tether itself is also not
[00:38:23] just sitting there um you know waiting
[00:38:25] for it to happen they also have plans
[00:38:27] and the works they've invested in this
[00:38:28] company a mic compliance stable coin
[00:38:30] issu called stab IR MH and obviously um
[00:38:34] this will we second investment in a St
[00:38:36] it's a second investment in a stable
[00:38:37] coin issue this month so they've got
[00:38:39] plans and they're going to they doing
[00:38:41] the things to get the regulatory
[00:38:43] requirements to be able to issue stable
[00:38:45] coins but one important thing to point
[00:38:47] out here is part of the mic requirements
[00:38:49] are that these stable coin issuers have
[00:38:53] to keep some of their reserves within EU
[00:38:55] Banks right Banks say Banks say now I
[00:38:59] happen to recall a particular moment
[00:39:00] when a stable coin issuer lost access to
[00:39:03] its reserves and DEP pegged because it
[00:39:05] kept its funds at a bank do you do that
[00:39:08] rings a bell yeah was it um um oh yeah
[00:39:11] it was Circle wasn't it Circle yeah they
[00:39:13] issue us small stable coin called usdc
[00:39:15] oh yeah yeah yeah so basically that
[00:39:17] happened in March last year the svb all
[00:39:19] that stuff but yeah banks are
[00:39:21] structurally uh insolvent due to
[00:39:23] fractional Reserve banking so you know
[00:39:26] it's like okay um if there is a bank run
[00:39:28] at the particular bank if there's any of
[00:39:30] these banking issues and Europe which
[00:39:31] let's say the European Banks they're not
[00:39:33] the most healthy banks in the world guys
[00:39:35] um I would feel a lot more I would feel
[00:39:36] a lot safer with the stable coins
[00:39:38] reserves held by you know Frank K
[00:39:41] Fitzgerald yeah you know with the with
[00:39:44] the CEO who is by the way a 5%
[00:39:46] shareholder in the company and the
[00:39:48] Commerce Secretary than uh a a stable
[00:39:51] coin isue that has to keep all its
[00:39:52] reserves in a European Bank Deutsche
[00:39:54] Bank I mean look at Deutsche bank's
[00:39:55] financials you wonder
[00:39:58] or any of those European Banks so yeah
[00:40:00] um it's just crazy fud and it's silly
[00:40:03] yeah yeah look I I think like I said
[00:40:05] earlier this is going to be this is
[00:40:07] mostly going to in inconvenience uh
[00:40:09] crypto users in the EU we shouldn't
[00:40:11] write off the EU as a market I think
[00:40:13] around 30% of of crypto transactions by
[00:40:16] value uh come froma came from the EU I
[00:40:19] think last year or over the course of
[00:40:20] this year so it's not an insignificant
[00:40:22] market and I can tell you like the um
[00:40:24] the coin Bureau events that we did in
[00:40:27] London in 22 and 23 like the amount of
[00:40:31] people the amount of coin buau viewers
[00:40:32] from Europe is was astonishing the
[00:40:35] amount of people who came over so I
[00:40:37] think there is a real market for crypto
[00:40:38] there people are interested in it and
[00:40:40] people are wanting to trade it so these
[00:40:42] people are the ones going to be
[00:40:43] inconvenience but it doesn't take away
[00:40:45] the fact that they are still going to
[00:40:46] have stable coin access because Circle
[00:40:49] has been you know positioning itself
[00:40:51] very well for this and I think it's kind
[00:40:52] of it's interesting that that that
[00:40:54] coinbase was the one that we referenced
[00:40:56] in that uh that coin um coin Telegraph
[00:40:59] referenced in that article earlier
[00:41:01] talking about delisting usdt obviously
[00:41:03] coinbase and circle are part of the
[00:41:05] center Consortium um so coinbase you
[00:41:07] might argue has something of an interest
[00:41:09] in usdc doing well um and it's uh it's
[00:41:14] easy to forget that Circle was
[00:41:15] instrumental in the drawing up of Micah
[00:41:18] when we covered Micah um for the first
[00:41:21] time a while back they they did a first
[00:41:22] draft which was then sent off for
[00:41:25] comments and and uh amend and whatever
[00:41:28] and the the hand of circle was very very
[00:41:31] clearly all over that when that second
[00:41:33] draft came back so Circle have been
[00:41:34] positioning themselves for a long time
[00:41:36] now obviously this is good for Circle um
[00:41:39] but it's it also means that uh EU users
[00:41:42] still do have stable coin access and I
[00:41:45] think that's important to remember um
[00:41:47] and as you pointed out you know tether
[00:41:49] are tether are taking steps in order to
[00:41:51] address this so I would imagine that
[00:41:54] tether will come out with a mic
[00:41:56] compliant stable coin before too long
[00:41:58] and given that you know given that there
[00:42:00] is this deadline until
[00:42:02] 2026 they've got all they've got a lot
[00:42:04] of time yeah exactly so yeah tether FS
[00:42:08] out there I'm sorry to say I think you
[00:42:10] guys have called this one wrong you guys
[00:42:12] need to go back to uh talking about why
[00:42:14] the moon landing never happened sorry
[00:42:16] it's like guys
[00:42:20] really sorry man um and uh it's worth
[00:42:23] mentioning as well just whilst we're on
[00:42:24] the subject of tether um tether you know
[00:42:26] this multi-billion dollar company um is
[00:42:29] throwing money around like crazy
[00:42:32] $775 million investment um uh this was
[00:42:36] in Rumble yes it's pocket change to
[00:42:38] these guys I mean really to be honest
[00:42:40] but it's a good I think it's a very good
[00:42:41] investment strategically aligns also
[00:42:43] Rumble is invested by David saaks David
[00:42:45] saxs is of course crypto are I can see
[00:42:48] the connections here so yeah tether is
[00:42:51] not as shy not loose of cash yeah don't
[00:42:54] panic guys like tether fud is is not
[00:42:56] something plenty of other things to
[00:42:58] worry about in 2025 but tether fud I
[00:43:00] don't think is one of them okay that is
[00:43:03] all the news items we wanted to talk
[00:43:04] about today let's move on before we do
[00:43:06] let's of course oh yes let's remind
[00:43:08] people to subscribe of course ring ring
[00:43:11] the bell and hit that like Buton yes
[00:43:14] very fire up those likes very important
[00:43:16] give us some likes for the end of the
[00:43:18] year think of it as a as a late
[00:43:20] Christmas present get a thousand likes
[00:43:22] before the view ends what are we going
[00:43:23] to do uh you could put some trousers on
[00:43:27] you can start only fans you guys let us
[00:43:28] know in the comments or would you rather
[00:43:29] want me to wear prod tries the whole
[00:43:31] rest of next year or guy to start a coin
[00:43:33] bu only fans let us know you got you you
[00:43:36] people really don't know what it's a
[00:43:38] democracy you know it's democracy that
[00:43:39] Cho I'm sure they would love the other L
[00:43:43] um agustino bores Sarah I hope I've
[00:43:46] pronounced that right says in the
[00:43:47] comments I'm an EU crypto investor and
[00:43:49] I've changed to usdc months ago see he's
[00:43:52] he's on top he's been watching Quia
[00:43:54] Sports since that beginning he knows
[00:43:56] it's been coming yeah I mean you know
[00:43:58] for warned is forearmed so um yeah I
[00:44:01] mean I think again I think this kind of
[00:44:03] underlines you know tether fud is is
[00:44:05] just that um okay so let's take a look
[00:44:08] at last week's top performing cryptos
[00:44:10] now this comes with a caveat today
[00:44:12] because quite a few you know it's a bad
[00:44:14] week when some of the biggest some of
[00:44:15] the biggest performers are centralized
[00:44:17] exchange tokens so we're not going to
[00:44:19] discuss the top performing centralized
[00:44:20] exchange tokens because usually it's you
[00:44:23] know usually they're just burning them
[00:44:25] or whatever policy it's new newly
[00:44:26] instructed polic
[00:44:27] company policy exactly exactly um and it
[00:44:31] doesn't even I think it doesn't really
[00:44:33] even reflect trading volumes half the
[00:44:35] time I think so uh we'll talk about the
[00:44:38] top performers from last week that were
[00:44:39] not centralized exchange tokens starting
[00:44:42] uh the clear winner is virtual this is
[00:44:45] virtuals protocol um the AI agent uh
[00:44:48] Launchpad um which has just been
[00:44:51] outperforming pretty much everything you
[00:44:53] know certainly certainly of the of the
[00:44:55] higher market cap cryptos it's now is
[00:44:57] that right number 39 you know what's
[00:44:59] crazy also that um about month ago or so
[00:45:03] um inside the coin Bureau Club Discord
[00:45:06] which by the way will be linked to below
[00:45:08] we um one of our researchers Kevin had
[00:45:10] been calling this out long ago yeah I
[00:45:11] think he must have been TW 20x since he
[00:45:13] called it out quite a few people within
[00:45:15] the Discord there have been raising
[00:45:16] Kevin's calls there on a lot of these AI
[00:45:18] agents and AI info plays yeah yeah so
[00:45:21] obviously uh you know for anyone
[00:45:23] approaching this AI agent narrative kind
[00:45:25] of virtuals is the sort of go to because
[00:45:27] it is you know it is the big infr playay
[00:45:30] um the the token itself is doing well uh
[00:45:33] well partly because people are
[00:45:34] speculating like hell on AI agents and
[00:45:36] this is kind of a you know perhaps an
[00:45:37] overall play rather than going for
[00:45:38] individual ones um but so speculation is
[00:45:42] playing a part but also like in order to
[00:45:44] use uh virtuals protocol in order to
[00:45:46] create an AI agent and I can tell you A
[00:45:48] lot of people are yeah um you have to
[00:45:51] you have to hold um virtuals uh you have
[00:45:54] to hold virtual tokens so I think it's a
[00:45:56] it's kind of a combination of
[00:45:58] speculation and use that is driving this
[00:46:01] so very exciting um speaking of another
[00:46:03] kind of hot narrative is move so
[00:46:06] obviously this is movement Labs which
[00:46:08] full disclosure we've invested in at
[00:46:09] coin Bureau um now the move token which
[00:46:12] recently launched about two weeks ago
[00:46:13] three weeks ago absolutely absolutely
[00:46:15] been crushing it out of the gates it's a
[00:46:17] move based ethereum layer 2 rollup um
[00:46:20] and um you know I won't go into
[00:46:22] technicalities of it but they recently
[00:46:24] integrated wbtc which of course provides
[00:46:26] more liquidity and active addresses is
[00:46:28] also Rising so it's obviously seen as a
[00:46:31] good kind of like P play on sui and
[00:46:33] eptos because obviously um it's built
[00:46:36] it's on top of ethereum as a layer too
[00:46:39] um but it's also utilized in the same
[00:46:40] programming language so it gives
[00:46:41] developer interoperability and utilizes
[00:46:43] ethereum for base layer settlement so
[00:46:46] yeah it's just been crushing it and they
[00:46:47] they were ones the few they got a TG out
[00:46:50] of tge coinbase listing which is very
[00:46:52] rare yeah on the team there so um yeah
[00:46:56] again it seems to be there's a just a
[00:46:59] lot of excitement around new coins at
[00:47:00] the moment it's the kind of new coin
[00:47:02] meta has surfaced partly because maybe
[00:47:03] this is a reaction to the sort of Dino
[00:47:05] coin meta from a few weeks back now
[00:47:07] everyone's switching to the newest stuff
[00:47:09] that they can get their hands on
[00:47:11] speaking of which another big G another
[00:47:13] one of the top gainers I knew you'd like
[00:47:15] that seg like that I saw that being
[00:47:18] lined up I saw that coming down the
[00:47:19] runway I was like he's going to get this
[00:47:21] he's gonna nail this and then spoil it
[00:47:23] by by calling it out uh so penu um pudgy
[00:47:27] the pudgy Penguins ecosystem token that
[00:47:29] got aird dropped to I mean pretty much
[00:47:32] everyone right I think You' have had to
[00:47:34] done you think you've had to work hard
[00:47:36] not to get the not to get the air drop
[00:47:38] um so obviously again this is the kind
[00:47:40] of new project method but they also seem
[00:47:41] to be building a pretty strong Community
[00:47:44] um penu itself has some top tier
[00:47:46] exchange listings binance bybit okx are
[00:47:49] all supporting it um I wonder whether
[00:47:53] some of the price appreciation that it's
[00:47:55] seen over the last week week or so I
[00:47:57] wonder if that's people obviously
[00:47:59] speculating but speculating maybe on the
[00:48:01] prospect of things like coinbase
[00:48:03] listings you know us centralized
[00:48:04] exchange listings Ian I think it's like
[00:48:07] it's potentially that because I would
[00:48:09] see it's a strong candidate right like
[00:48:11] it's very
[00:48:12] decentralized um It's associated with a
[00:48:15] well-known brand and they've listed
[00:48:17] other coins they've listed what Pepe
[00:48:19] Bonk what else popat they list popcat
[00:48:23] yeah I think so yeah with so I don't see
[00:48:25] why they wouldn't list pangu you yeah so
[00:48:27] I wonder if some of the coming down it
[00:48:28] will it'll come down the PPE somewhere
[00:48:31] yeah um okay what's up next next up CRV
[00:48:35] now obviously this is the um I think
[00:48:37] this we've seen this did well recently
[00:48:39] about two three weeks ago was one of the
[00:48:40] top gainers um maybe people buying the
[00:48:42] dip because of the S you know SCV USD
[00:48:46] returns that have been generated within
[00:48:47] the protocol um but yeah it's I mean
[00:48:50] maybe it's just people buying the
[00:48:51] balance back up you know as it dipped
[00:48:53] yeah the founder got liquidated again
[00:48:55] again yeah yeah
[00:48:57] um I don't know if we've got the article
[00:48:58] oh yeah here we are so yeah CRV as Nick
[00:49:00] says was one of the top gainers I think
[00:49:02] a couple of weeks ago and this was
[00:49:03] because of they launched this scrv USD
[00:49:06] which is yield bearing stable coin he is
[00:49:09] a Deen on like a Deen in form he is the
[00:49:11] guy who took out he used his CRV if I
[00:49:14] recall about last year or the year last
[00:49:16] year to go and buy a mansion in in
[00:49:19] Sydney oh yeah the guy yeah the guy
[00:49:21] who's yeah
[00:49:23] Manion okay well he's he's riding that
[00:49:26] way isn't he
[00:49:27] had some UPS he's had maning the GU like
[00:49:29] he's using his protocol and he's
[00:49:31] leveraging like in true dgen fashion
[00:49:33] leveraging the hell out of his CRV
[00:49:35] positions to go and buy I me you know he
[00:49:37] living a a degenerate good for him good
[00:49:39] for him good for him okay so yeah I
[00:49:41] think um it took CRV took a dip and has
[00:49:43] now sort of bounced back up so that
[00:49:44] might explain why it's one of the top
[00:49:45] gainers um and last but not least among
[00:49:48] the top gainers we have uh radium um now
[00:49:51] this was a couple of weeks ago I think
[00:49:52] this was announced but radium recently
[00:49:54] beat Unis swap in terms of monthly
[00:49:56] volume um monthly decks volume um and I
[00:50:00] mean you know I guess I I guess that's
[00:50:02] sort of playing still playing out I kind
[00:50:04] of Wonder as well whether Ray might be a
[00:50:07] sort of better reflection of the
[00:50:10] activity happening on salana than Saul
[00:50:12] itself do you know what I mean it's like
[00:50:14] you know um Soul hasn't seen much
[00:50:17] appreciation because of everything
[00:50:18] happening on the network but radium
[00:50:20] perhaps has you know because so many
[00:50:21] people are using using the decks yeah
[00:50:23] exactly yeah so it's done very well it's
[00:50:26] the top right yeah yeah and obviously
[00:50:28] benefiting from uh continued sort of
[00:50:31] mcoin
[00:50:33] degeneracy okay so uh that was uh that
[00:50:37] was last week's top gainers excluding
[00:50:39] centralized exchange tokens let's have a
[00:50:41] look at some tweets of the week now the
[00:50:44] first one is one that we did actually
[00:50:46] reference in last week's stream um but I
[00:50:48] think this was an important one um this
[00:50:51] got a lot of people talking so this was
[00:50:53] uh tavano um Tay is a white hat hacker
[00:50:57] white hat hacker I think she also works
[00:50:59] at metamask or worked at myall or
[00:51:02] something I think um and she's a white
[00:51:04] hat hacker and yeah she she brought this
[00:51:06] to the attention of the community that
[00:51:08] the dprk which is of course North
[00:51:10] Korea's Infamous hacking group had been
[00:51:12] trading on hyper liquid and of course
[00:51:15] they don't trade right and she points
[00:51:16] out she yel dprk doesn't trade dprk
[00:51:20] tests which of course is reference to
[00:51:22] pen testing checking out testing where
[00:51:25] are the vulnerabilities where are
[00:51:26] potential opportunities um now this
[00:51:29] obviously the Tweet itself is one thing
[00:51:30] but I think it's the you know the F furo
[00:51:33] that erupted afterwards many people
[00:51:35] accused or fuding call their names all
[00:51:36] this kind of stuff but it is a good
[00:51:38] point I mean and in the fact that you
[00:51:41] know hyper liquid Indy people talked
[00:51:42] about on the one hand it's only two or
[00:51:44] three multi for these four validators
[00:51:46] and all this kind of stuff and could
[00:51:48] they be at risk um but I think the point
[00:51:50] share is that if a no matter what the
[00:51:52] Yack hacker is saying right I think if a
[00:51:55] yack haacker is pointing out that there
[00:51:58] is that the you know the North Korean
[00:52:00] hacking group is testing or using your
[00:52:02] protocol it's a CA of concern so you'd
[00:52:04] want to engage you know you you
[00:52:06] irrespective like they may not be may do
[00:52:08] it in a different fashion and you may
[00:52:10] find acceptable but it's a matter to
[00:52:12] jump on that not to call it fud but to
[00:52:13] address it right um no one's out here to
[00:52:16] necessarily fud um because it is true
[00:52:18] it's all onchain it's all verifiable lot
[00:52:20] people came out to defend her as well
[00:52:22] yeah there were some pretty idiotic
[00:52:23] takes I think that she had some sort of
[00:52:25] other motive it's like well you know
[00:52:27] let's just it's worth checking isn't it
[00:52:29] you know uh I don't think I don't think
[00:52:31] there was this was fuding hyper liquid
[00:52:33] for for no good reason we don't want H
[00:52:35] we don't want Kim Jong-un and his lackes
[00:52:38] to get away with another billion dollar
[00:52:40] hack that would have been a disaster
[00:52:41] better safe than sorry yeah okay uh
[00:52:44] let's have a look at the next tweet of
[00:52:46] the week um what what is going on here
[00:52:49] I'm seeing big numbers big numbers so
[00:52:51] the story behind this now this is this
[00:52:53] mea meme coin that was launched the back
[00:52:55] story is this guy he basically out a
[00:52:56] request he says he's got his daughter um
[00:52:59] has got a rare condition um a rare
[00:53:01] terminal condition of some description
[00:53:03] that needs research and funding and all
[00:53:04] this puts out the request and you know a
[00:53:07] call for Action from the community and
[00:53:09] what does the Deens within the community
[00:53:11] do well they create a meme coin of
[00:53:14] course though there is a good happy end
[00:53:16] in here because they send most of the
[00:53:17] supply to the guy it creates a lot of
[00:53:19] excite there's a narrative about Meera
[00:53:21] and there's a lot of you know awareness
[00:53:23] for mea this meme coin he had a bit of a
[00:53:26] trouble because he he wanted to know how
[00:53:28] am I going to convert this into some
[00:53:29] Fiat so I could use it for the funding
[00:53:31] which he did manage to do um obviously
[00:53:34] people traded the mcoin after that there
[00:53:35] was some you know FR fra afterwards
[00:53:38] about like oh did some influences trade
[00:53:41] it before and dump on others or whatnot
[00:53:43] but that doesn't change the fact that it
[00:53:44] was a good news story of mem coins
[00:53:46] specifically a mem coin that was
[00:53:48] launched on pump. fund so that's a good
[00:53:51] news story someone's actually value
[00:53:53] value created now obviously they were
[00:53:55] there's always going to be losers in the
[00:53:56] memec coin game but at least in this
[00:53:58] case it was going to a good cause for
[00:54:00] somebody right so that's a good news
[00:54:02] story for mem coins yeah compared to all
[00:54:04] the others we've seen throughout year
[00:54:05] who would have thought crowdfunding
[00:54:07] crypto is coming for crowdfunding in the
[00:54:09] form of mem coins in the forms of meme
[00:54:11] coins launched on on an aggregator mean
[00:54:12] coin generator that whole sector is
[00:54:14] about to be where being disrupted okay
[00:54:17] uh right next tweet of the week is
[00:54:21] uh that is so true man yeah that is so
[00:54:25] true I picked that out I remember
[00:54:26] picking that out yeah I think it's that
[00:54:28] sort of thing it's like yeah you you
[00:54:30] study and study and it kind of Jades you
[00:54:32] as well because I think sometimes you
[00:54:33] study something so in depth you'll dig
[00:54:36] into everything and you'll consider it
[00:54:38] very very carefully and you put some you
[00:54:40] know ecomics when of the unlocks come in
[00:54:43] what is the what is the consensus
[00:54:44] mechanism how does this compare you know
[00:54:47] yeah what is the TPS you know I need to
[00:54:49] study this I need to put my my due
[00:54:51] diligence sheet and all that meanwhile
[00:54:52] the guy next door is basically just aped
[00:54:54] all onto some sort of a pump launch
[00:54:56] meanwhile the 11year old next door like
[00:54:59] I just bought popcat at like January oh
[00:55:02] my God yeah it's uh I think I think that
[00:55:05] kind of as well as being quite a funny
[00:55:07] meme I think it sort of reflects as a
[00:55:09] genuine frustration perhaps okay uh next
[00:55:12] tweet of last week is this one oh this
[00:55:16] hilarious okay well no it's actually sad
[00:55:19] um I mean so and guys don't know the
[00:55:21] context there's a new squid game out
[00:55:23] squid game 2 right now apparently one of
[00:55:26] the characters in this squid
[00:55:30] games is a a crypto influencer right um
[00:55:35] and he basically when he comes when he
[00:55:37] wakes up he's complaining he doesn't
[00:55:38] have his phone he can't check the market
[00:55:40] all this kind of stuff and he says I've
[00:55:42] got money invested and then this guy
[00:55:43] says you know player 333 you basically
[00:55:47] are um your age 30 former owner of the
[00:55:51] YouTube
[00:55:52] channel mg coin so they're taking a shot
[00:55:54] at it a crypto YouTube here right but
[00:55:57] not only that they promoted Dalmation a
[00:55:59] new cryptocurrency leading his
[00:56:01] subscribers to lose 15.2 billion ywn so
[00:56:06] basically and he shut down his channel
[00:56:08] and disappeared so basically on squid
[00:56:09] games a very popular Channel all around
[00:56:11] the world now they're going out there
[00:56:12] taking shots at crypto YouTubers so
[00:56:14] basically now we're so bad so bad crypto
[00:56:17] scammer who's a YouTuber why could I
[00:56:19] just go Twitter like a Twitter
[00:56:21] influencer why does he have to be a
[00:56:22] YouTuber like specifically like come on
[00:56:26] I mean we we try our best we try our
[00:56:29] best and we now get literally um I I
[00:56:32] think it's factually inaccurate because
[00:56:34] as from what I from what little I know
[00:56:36] of the South Korean crypto market and
[00:56:37] actually one of our one of our great
[00:56:39] researchers yeah is based in South Korea
[00:56:41] from what I know of uh South Korean
[00:56:43] crypto they don't tend to use YouTube
[00:56:45] that much they don't I think it's used
[00:56:46] in the apps telegram is very popular and
[00:56:48] then also obviously the the line the
[00:56:50] apps like line I think line talk yeah so
[00:56:54] it's factually inaccurate so uh yeah get
[00:56:56] your do your research Netflix um Zara
[00:56:59] you were watching you've been watching
[00:57:01] sum of squid game too does that get a
[00:57:02] thumbs up or a thumbs down thumbs up oh
[00:57:06] no two thumbs uh she's so so Zara Zara
[00:57:09] our producer is so so on it okay uh
[00:57:12] right another tweet of the week is this
[00:57:14] the final tweet of the week or we've got
[00:57:15] two more oh yes this is from Rob our
[00:57:17] good friend Rob over at digital asset
[00:57:19] news now this is the final uh final
[00:57:21] tweet in in a thread about security
[00:57:24] crypto security um this is something
[00:57:26] that you need to be taking seriously
[00:57:28] folks my bet is that most of you
[00:57:29] probably aren't taking it seriously
[00:57:31] enough so um what the uh what Rob was
[00:57:34] talking about at the beginning of this
[00:57:36] thread was the fact that uh those two
[00:57:37] Factor authentication codes that you use
[00:57:41] um with you know usually with Google
[00:57:42] tofa um there is a you've got to make
[00:57:45] sure they're not being backed up to the
[00:57:47] cloud there's a little Cloud icon I
[00:57:49] think that true and then sometimes also
[00:57:51] when you setting up two Factor
[00:57:52] authentication especially with
[00:57:53] authenticator apps on exchanges they
[00:57:55] give you the option to save a um you
[00:57:58] know back not back door but it's like a
[00:58:00] seed it's like a collection of words or
[00:58:01] like a phrase or something that you can
[00:58:03] then save collection of numbers and
[00:58:05] letters and this is basically allows you
[00:58:08] to bypass it if if you ever lose access
[00:58:10] to your TFA and people save this in the
[00:58:12] cloud never ever save anything like that
[00:58:15] especially like same thing with seed
[00:58:16] wordss on the cloud yeah and I would
[00:58:18] he's mentioned rubico there which is a
[00:58:20] good point because all of our especially
[00:58:22] like our YouTubes and all that kind of
[00:58:24] stuff it's secured through a ubco same
[00:58:26] thing you can use ubo on exchanges ubo
[00:58:28] is a physical device that you only
[00:58:30] people who have access to this ubo and
[00:58:33] click on it can log into it that's the
[00:58:35] most secure I think form of tofa and you
[00:58:38] can have multiple levels as well yeah
[00:58:40] yeah so uh yeah take your crypto
[00:58:42] security seriously folks don't be don't
[00:58:45] be that person that gets that gets
[00:58:47] scammed because as the as the bull
[00:58:48] market gathers steam we're just going to
[00:58:50] see more and more of these of these
[00:58:52] hacks and scams so protect yourselves at
[00:58:55] all costs okay uh that is that is it for
[00:58:58] tweets of the week any coins to watch
[00:59:00] next week only two not massive to be
[00:59:01] honest there's two unlocks one unlock
[00:59:04] that we that's well what's this xrp
[00:59:07] firstly but this is the monthly regular
[00:59:08] monthly 1 billion xrp unlock that's by
[00:59:12] 1.8% of the circulating supply of rple
[00:59:14] so it shows you how much circulating
[00:59:15] Supply there is um but yeah I mean I I
[00:59:18] don't expect it to it comes monthly so
[00:59:20] it's known I don't expect it to have
[00:59:22] impacted that much obviously all
[00:59:24] increases in Supply should technically
[00:59:26] lead to a for in price but I don't think
[00:59:27] it's going to have that much of an
[00:59:28] impact It's relatively small that
[00:59:30] compared to the sui one which is another
[00:59:32] unlock these are both on the 1st of
[00:59:33] January by the way um which is also part
[00:59:35] of the regular monthly unlocks at 2.19%
[00:59:38] of the circulating Supply um so it's not
[00:59:41] massive and we've had these regularly as
[00:59:43] I say monthly um but it's something
[00:59:45] we're still putting in your calendar to
[00:59:47] note yeah yeah okay so I mean yeah we're
[00:59:51] sort of in that quite quiet period uh as
[00:59:53] the year as the year winds down I think
[00:59:56] think it's going to start getting crazy
[00:59:57] in uh in January again um a lot of
[00:59:59] people losing their minds in the
