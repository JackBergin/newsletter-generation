# Raw Transcript

[00:00:01] with just 48 hours left to close off
[00:00:04] 2024 many may be wondering what Bitcoin
[00:00:07] has in store for 2025 as well as the
[00:00:10] broader crypto sector well if we have a
[00:00:12] look at Bitcoin right now trading at
[00:00:16] $3,539 you can see that the volume has
[00:00:18] dropped off massively and Bitcoin is
[00:00:21] looking like it's right on a knife's
[00:00:23] edge about to drop down to the lower
[00:00:25] support level so in Today Show we'll
[00:00:27] have a look at what this means leading
[00:00:28] into next year where altcoin still have
[00:00:31] a chance to pump into
[00:00:33] 2025 as suggested by the prior data and
[00:00:37] we'll have a look at whether Bitcoin and
[00:00:38] the crypto Market has deviated from what
[00:00:41] we've previously seen at this point in
[00:00:43] time as per the prior Cycles so let's
[00:00:47] get straight into the show content smash
[00:00:49] the like button hit the Bell
[00:00:50] notification And subscribe to the
[00:00:52] channel and I think one of the first
[00:00:53] things we need to look at over here is
[00:00:55] the stock market which previously when
[00:00:57] Bitcoin had its most recent drop a
[00:01:00] couple of weeks ago was under immense
[00:01:02] pressure due to the actual stock market
[00:01:04] and if you look at the S&P 500 the
[00:01:06] NASDAQ on the top right and then the Dow
[00:01:08] Jones Industrial Average on the bottom
[00:01:10] line it seems to be a lot more stable
[00:01:12] than what we're seeing structurally
[00:01:14] compared to bitcoin uh still maintaining
[00:01:16] that uptrend with higher highs and
[00:01:17] higher lows uh we do still have of
[00:01:20] course on the NASDAQ as well as the S&P
[00:01:23] 500 on the top charts over here uh the
[00:01:26] presence of a rising wedge formation
[00:01:28] which is traditionally a bearish for
[00:01:29] formation and we started to show signs
[00:01:32] at least on the S&P 500 of breaking that
[00:01:34] down over there but we did find
[00:01:36] horizontal support so we'll need to
[00:01:38] monitor this leading into 2025 if there
[00:01:41] is a broader breakdown over here of
[00:01:43] course that could add immense pressure
[00:01:45] into crypto now the biggest concern with
[00:01:47] crypto which is not a abnormal leading
[00:01:50] into this seasonal period that being
[00:01:53] over the Christmas New Year's period
[00:01:55] where most of the world that do go on
[00:01:57] vacation and their minds are off of the
[00:01:59] charts well one of the bigger concerns
[00:02:02] is the drop off over here in the daily
[00:02:04] exchange volumes now again it's not
[00:02:06] completely out of the normal out of the
[00:02:08] question it's just that structurally we
[00:02:10] wanted to see this defend that1 billion
[00:02:13] Mark and you can see this is now
[00:02:14] dropping multiple days and holding this
[00:02:17] this underneath this line chart
[00:02:19] underneath that h100 billion Mark which
[00:02:22] is a little bit of a cause for concern
[00:02:24] so we need to see new volume come back
[00:02:26] into the market very very quickly uh
[00:02:28] maybe during the
[00:02:30] inauguration happening in January as
[00:02:33] well as around the fomc meeting that we
[00:02:36] could see some sort of rate cut as well
[00:02:38] as quantitative easing stimulus that
[00:02:41] comes back in and that could easily push
[00:02:43] us back towards the upside but as it
[00:02:45] currently stands it's without a doubt
[00:02:48] structurally the charts don't look great
[00:02:50] for Bitcoin you can see the bearish
[00:02:52] Divergence that occurred all the way
[00:02:54] back in 20 21 within that cycle over
[00:02:57] here between the RSI and price well
[00:02:59] we're actually structurally printing
[00:03:01] something very very very similar which
[00:03:03] is why we need to see that volume come
[00:03:05] back in to essentially save the day and
[00:03:08] for Bitcoin to start to take out those
[00:03:10] prior highs and have continuation of the
[00:03:12] trend failure to do that does mean that
[00:03:14] we could see much much lower prices and
[00:03:17] at least on some of the time frames it
[00:03:19] is looking bad because you can see how
[00:03:21] bitcoin's Holding On by knife's Edge
[00:03:23] over here and the lowest support levels
[00:03:25] which are most notably going to be
[00:03:26] coming in between 80 and $85,000
[00:03:29] would mean that if Bitcoin does get to
[00:03:31] that level it is ultimately going to
[00:03:33] break the Stop and versal indicator
[00:03:36] which we have situated uh right over
[00:03:38] there currently this week uh it's
[00:03:40] sitting at $87,500
[00:03:43] so if you do break that well
[00:03:45] structurally you will find Support over
[00:03:47] there but you're going to start to have
[00:03:49] a potential for a high time frame
[00:03:51] downtrend beginning to form and we know
[00:03:54] that the trend is your friend so the end
[00:03:55] of the trend and you don't want to be
[00:03:57] betting against those High time frame
[00:03:59] Trends uh which currently is still
[00:04:00] towards the upside but again if you
[00:04:02] start to threaten these low regions uh
[00:04:04] you could start to reverse that very
[00:04:06] very quickly we've seen a very good
[00:04:08] reset in the crypto and greed index
[00:04:10] coming down to 50 which is a healthy
[00:04:12] sign again if we can see that volume
[00:04:15] tick back up reclaiming the100 billion
[00:04:17] Mark while simultaneously um the uh High
[00:04:20] highs and high lows form on the low time
[00:04:22] frames well then this would be
[00:04:24] considered a very very healthy reset
[00:04:26] coming back into the neutral territory
[00:04:28] and we'll have a look just now just at
[00:04:30] how the overall risk within the crypto
[00:04:32] Market has also been heavily reset and
[00:04:35] that is a little bit of hope that 2025
[00:04:37] does play out as the post Haring year
[00:04:40] top which we we typically see if you're
[00:04:43] comparing back to the price Cycles
[00:04:44] remember following the election year
[00:04:46] which simultaneously coincides with
[00:04:49] following the post Haring cycle that is
[00:04:51] typically the year where we see Bitcoin
[00:04:53] dominance drop aggressively towards the
[00:04:55] downside an altcoin season commence and
[00:04:58] the market tends to top on Extreme greed
[00:05:00] we haven't yet seen that we're still
[00:05:01] anticipating that that could come next
[00:05:03] year so if you do have a look at this
[00:05:05] over here you can see that uh the
[00:05:08] funding rates have also come down
[00:05:09] heavily alongside the volume which is of
[00:05:12] course one of the healthy signs over
[00:05:13] there um flashing a lot of the leverage
[00:05:16] out of the market flushing the late
[00:05:18] buyers out of the market and now we we
[00:05:20] need to keep an eye out on this if this
[00:05:22] does flip negative whilst coming into
[00:05:24] strong support that would actually be a
[00:05:26] strong Buy Signal just like we've seen
[00:05:28] previously throughout Co throughout the
[00:05:31] FTX collapse the usdc dpeg and again the
[00:05:34] Yen Cash and Carry trade and wi So
[00:05:36] within this crypto cycle we've only seen
[00:05:38] three of those environments while in a
[00:05:40] strong uptrend that we had negative
[00:05:41] funding now another thing that I'm
[00:05:43] keeping a close eye out on is the usdt
[00:05:47] dominance now the usdt dominance you can
[00:05:49] see is range bound over here but from a
[00:05:52] high time frame perspective when zooming
[00:05:54] out this still is forming part of a
[00:05:56] massive uh a massive uh uptrend coming
[00:06:00] into a strong 7year support level so
[00:06:03] we'll keep an eye on this if this does
[00:06:04] drop this level over here which we're
[00:06:06] currently coming into resistance you
[00:06:08] could see a move down lower towards the
[00:06:09] support level around that 3.7% zone that
[00:06:12] would bring um new liquidity into the
[00:06:15] market and you should see that volume
[00:06:17] rise and prices run up but the fact that
[00:06:19] it's trading up over here towards the
[00:06:22] resistance Zone threatening to possibly
[00:06:24] flip this into support is another cause
[00:06:26] for concern and the reason why is if we
[00:06:29] go out on to let's go in the 3-day time
[00:06:31] frame over here I can showcase to you
[00:06:33] what previously happened the vertical
[00:06:35] lines running down the screen over here
[00:06:37] each of those tests into that yellow UPS
[00:06:39] sloping trend line has resulted in major
[00:06:42] cycle tops now if I can just remind you
[00:06:45] what happened in 2021 you can see 2021
[00:06:49] this was the exact cycle top within this
[00:06:51] region over here price bounces and moves
[00:06:53] towards the upside and we of course do
[00:06:56] have the um same print over here as well
[00:07:00] with the bearish Divergence between the
[00:07:02] RSI and price on the weekly time frame
[00:07:04] in 2021 just like we have right now well
[00:07:07] simultaneously coming into some of those
[00:07:09] key levels again this just shows the
[00:07:12] importance of why we need to see
[00:07:13] something uh come into the market that
[00:07:16] will bring back uh that at least Hope
[00:07:19] and New Found volume and momentum that
[00:07:21] can get prices moving once again
[00:07:23] otherwise apathy will persist and you'll
[00:07:25] continue to see prices roll over which
[00:07:27] is what we're seeing over here again it
[00:07:29] looks heavy and your next major supports
[00:07:31] are coming down towards the $85,000 Zone
[00:07:35] this would be your interim first area of
[00:07:36] support depending on when you hit that
[00:07:38] level and then your next level of
[00:07:40] support and that's coming in by the way
[00:07:42] at the 0.382 your bull furb which is con
[00:07:46] which is commonly an area where price
[00:07:48] does find support now if you do lose
[00:07:50] that area you do have very very strong
[00:07:52] support in the form of the blue moving
[00:07:54] averages over here that's your 200 EMA
[00:07:57] and your 200 Ma and those should simult
[00:07:59] ously line up over here with your 50%
[00:08:02] level of the range at which point you're
[00:08:03] looking for support to come in at
[00:08:06] $78,000 now remember nothing ever moves
[00:08:08] in a straight line so if those High time
[00:08:11] frame bearish Divergence were to play
[00:08:13] out we should still inevitably see a
[00:08:16] massive Bounce from this region which
[00:08:18] would lead into a complacency bounce and
[00:08:20] a lower high maybe failing below this
[00:08:23] $108,000 region if that does happen of
[00:08:26] course then you're looking for a deeper
[00:08:28] drop over there and prices to go much
[00:08:30] lower now we can see over here if you
[00:08:33] look at Bitcoin as well on the 4-Hour
[00:08:35] time frame you do have also between the
[00:08:37] 50 and 200 EMA a bearish cross which is
[00:08:40] currently taking place so this
[00:08:42] solidifies what we're seeing over here
[00:08:44] that you are most likely going to
[00:08:45] revisit that $85,000 region and you
[00:08:48] should expect that prices should come
[00:08:50] down towards those support levels if we
[00:08:52] look at the total cryptocurrency market
[00:08:54] cap while we're still trading above
[00:08:56] those prior all-time highs from 2021
[00:08:59] which is is one good sign we can quickly
[00:09:01] go through to Total two as well you can
[00:09:03] see total 2's yet to take out the 2021
[00:09:06] highs total 3 also has Wicked briefly
[00:09:09] above 2021 highs and it does have the
[00:09:12] horizontal support coming in at about
[00:09:14] 8205 to $830 billion market cap an
[00:09:18] important level to hold up you have the
[00:09:20] others which refers to the altcoin
[00:09:22] sector back testing into that breakout
[00:09:25] level over there and holding that as
[00:09:27] support So an important level to
[00:09:28] constantly see price holding above um
[00:09:31] we'll tie this in with the Bitcoin
[00:09:32] dominance in just a moment if we do see
[00:09:34] Bitcoin dominance rolling over uh this
[00:09:37] should drive this towards the UPS then
[00:09:38] that would make things play out just
[00:09:40] like we saw in the price cycles and what
[00:09:42] we have seen in the price Cycles is this
[00:09:44] right don't bet against
[00:09:46] 2025 in q1 and the reason why is because
[00:09:50] again in a post Haring year uh this is
[00:09:53] what you typically see you expect price
[00:09:55] to top out in that post Haring year so
[00:09:58] 2017 20 2021 and then you can add four
[00:10:01] years to that which would take it into
[00:10:03] 2025 and we tend to see a very very
[00:10:06] strong q1 so although the market doesn't
[00:10:09] look great at the moment things can
[00:10:11] definitely very very quickly turn and
[00:10:13] when we simply use um this tool over
[00:10:16] here which looks at various different
[00:10:18] things uh various different onchain
[00:10:20] metrics social metrics uh you look at
[00:10:22] market cap risk fan greed indexes
[00:10:24] running return on investment in terms of
[00:10:26] where we are in the timing cycle YouTube
[00:10:28] views it collates all this information
[00:10:31] into one easy to rechart which simply is
[00:10:33] colorcoded and suggests are you in
[00:10:36] extremely high risk environments to be
[00:10:38] getting into the market or are you in
[00:10:40] lowrisk environments or is it business
[00:10:42] as usual and the markets in a normal uh
[00:10:45] Zone well the latest value suggest that
[00:10:48] we at
[00:10:49] 0.43 um and remember the market tends to
[00:10:52] top at 0.9 to one so think of this as a
[00:10:54] percentage at 90 to 100% the market is
[00:10:58] extremely overheated intend to top as it
[00:11:00] currently stands we're sitting at about
[00:11:03] 40 43% in terms of the risk metrics
[00:11:06] which you can see um is theoretically
[00:11:09] still before you get those cycle Peaks
[00:11:12] right the cycle Peaks tend to occur uh
[00:11:14] in the 80 to 100% region as I've just
[00:11:17] popped on to the Chart over here and we
[00:11:19] haven't actually seen that at all not
[00:11:21] even once within the cycle so that would
[00:11:23] bring some at least much needed hopium
[00:11:26] that you would see continuation of the
[00:11:27] price Cycles Trends and again if you
[00:11:30] just overlay this cycle in comparison to
[00:11:32] the price cycles that is the one thing
[00:11:34] that brings um a little bit of at least
[00:11:37] uh hope that the market will continue
[00:11:39] towards the upside and the cycle is not
[00:11:41] yet over right uh since many people
[00:11:43] would only have entered into the cycle
[00:11:45] recently uh they will be feeling heavy
[00:11:48] heavy pressure if they didn't get in as
[00:11:50] early as we did all the way back at the
[00:11:52] cycle lows so again uh we do need to see
[00:11:56] that volume come back into the market
[00:11:57] this is possibly one of the most most
[00:11:59] important metrics because this actually
[00:12:01] shows physically where people are
[00:12:03] putting their money where their mouth is
[00:12:05] and depositing Capital onto the
[00:12:06] exchanges remember this is the daily
[00:12:08] exchange volume with a 7-Day moving
[00:12:10] average showing how much volume is being
[00:12:13] traded on exchanges how much volume and
[00:12:14] capital is moving onto that exchange and
[00:12:17] if this number goes towards the upside
[00:12:19] you can see that the market is
[00:12:21] optimistic and we need to see that
[00:12:23] optimism come back to remain in line
[00:12:25] with what we've seen in the price cycle
[00:12:27] so the expectation would be that
[00:12:31] price Cycles we should be seeing a cycle
[00:12:34] Peak or top somewhere around October of
[00:12:37] 2025 so uh another important thing to be
[00:12:39] looking at of course is the Bitcoin
[00:12:41] dominance which has been range bound
[00:12:43] we've been focusing on the trading range
[00:12:45] from the high to the low over here and
[00:12:47] ultimately what you can see over here is
[00:12:49] the pink line is the Range High the
[00:12:51] middle one over there is the mid-range
[00:12:52] and then we have the range low and then
[00:12:54] we're specifically looking at the 0.786
[00:12:56] and the 0.661
[00:12:59] eight which is a common rejection Point
[00:13:02] using a Fibonacci Fibonacci retracement
[00:13:04] zone so we had price move up over here
[00:13:07] or at least the Bitcoin dominance move
[00:13:09] up and we did get that rejection in
[00:13:11] terms of the low time frame this is your
[00:13:13] 4-Hour time frame you do have um the
[00:13:15] start of a downtrend with of course a
[00:13:17] peak over there and now you're starting
[00:13:18] to put in those lower lows and lower
[00:13:20] highs so if we can see continuation of
[00:13:22] this breakdown again this would bring
[00:13:25] optimism back into the market that
[00:13:26] things are actually playing out like we
[00:13:28] saw in the price CLE
[00:13:29] where we expect a strong q1 and then
[00:13:31] specifically we see a big altcoin catch
[00:13:34] up right but it's really really
[00:13:36] important to look at how things play out
[00:13:38] together because simultaneously you
[00:13:40] would want to see that usdt dominance
[00:13:42] also break towards the downside so the
[00:13:45] best time or the best case scenarios is
[00:13:47] when you see Bitcoin form a strong range
[00:13:49] this range could be anywhere between
[00:13:51] about $ 80,000 and $110,000 Mark where
[00:13:54] you see Bitcoin over 2025 range within
[00:13:58] that territory while s multaneously usdt
[00:14:00] dominance breaks down and simultaneously
[00:14:03] you have Bitcoin dominance breaking down
[00:14:05] like this and if we do get that
[00:14:06] breakdown that should allow for the
[00:14:08] altcoins to catch a bit now I will
[00:14:11] remind you over here what we've seen
[00:14:12] previously within the Bitcoin dominances
[00:14:15] uh essentially you have three years of
[00:14:17] up or sideways followed by one year of
[00:14:20] straight down so we're still waiting for
[00:14:21] that one year of straight down which is
[00:14:23] why although it feels incredibly
[00:14:25] uncomfortable if you are playing the
[00:14:26] cycle out as per how the price Cycles
[00:14:29] have play out then you would want to be
[00:14:31] looking to have your exposure into the
[00:14:32] altcoin uh sector more heavy at this
[00:14:35] point of the cycle compared to let's say
[00:14:38] one or two years ago where you would
[00:14:39] have wanted to be very very heavy into
[00:14:42] uh Bitcoin since the Bitcoin dominance
[00:14:44] was of course trending towards the
[00:14:46] upside so only time will tell what's
[00:14:49] going to play out but essentially we're
[00:14:50] playing it level to level and we do have
[00:14:52] the start of a low time frame downtrend
[00:14:54] over there now we can also look to some
[00:14:56] of the high time frame uh charts as well
[00:15:00] as the majors within the crypto sector
[00:15:03] such as salana right salana is finding
[00:15:06] major Support over here it's really
[00:15:08] really important that salana does start
[00:15:09] to break back up above some of those key
[00:15:11] levels most notably above about $210 but
[00:15:15] if you do use our moving averages we
[00:15:17] have the three the nine and the 30 you
[00:15:19] can see of course salana was one of the
[00:15:21] first to move into the downtrend which
[00:15:23] means that it could be one of the first
[00:15:25] to bounce out of these zones and I'll
[00:15:26] show you why in just a minute so coming
[00:15:28] in to support into the 30 ma which is
[00:15:31] now Rising plus you have the breakout
[00:15:33] level of the Range High coming in around
[00:15:34] that $200 mark this is a key and
[00:15:37] important Zone where you do want to see
[00:15:39] that support found you want to see
[00:15:40] closing candles above here and then form
[00:15:43] that high low and continuation onwards
[00:15:45] and upwards when you look at the
[00:15:47] posturing of the moving averages in
[00:15:49] comparison to bitcoin per se well you
[00:15:52] can see Bitcoin uh is only just now
[00:15:54] losing the three um and the nine moving
[00:15:57] average and it means that major support
[00:15:59] comes down towards the 50 which is of
[00:16:01] course Rising each and every single
[00:16:03] candle close uh which means that it
[00:16:05] could meet up in a couple of days time
[00:16:07] around that $80,000 to $85,000 Mark
[00:16:10] which we said was major major support so
[00:16:13] uh there is a lot of free space
[00:16:15] underneath here where Solana is showing
[00:16:17] a bit of a different picture which again
[00:16:19] shows that maybe that Bitcoin dominance
[00:16:21] is actually going to break down if we
[00:16:23] look at ethereum as well ethereum is
[00:16:24] closer to its 30 than what Bitcoin is
[00:16:26] Bitcoin was very overextended from the
[00:16:29] 30-day moving average and we can quickly
[00:16:32] take a look at maybe a couple of the
[00:16:34] other Majors let's have a look at uh for
[00:16:37] example let's have a look at quickly uh
[00:16:40] we'll go to Nia let's see what ni is
[00:16:42] looking like okay ni coming right into
[00:16:44] the support level over there we'll have
[00:16:46] a look at some of the older coins like
[00:16:47] cardano cardano looking similar to
[00:16:50] bitcoin also far extended from the 50
[00:16:52] which is coming down at about 56 cents
[00:16:54] uh we'll have a look at madic how's
[00:16:56] madic doing so madic also coming right
[00:16:58] into support so you can see there is a
[00:17:00] little bit of a different picture when
[00:17:02] it comes to the altcoin sector most of
[00:17:04] them have not overextended quite as far
[00:17:06] as what Bitcoin has which shows that
[00:17:08] maybe just maybe you will actually get
[00:17:10] that shift out of Bitcoin so although
[00:17:12] things look bearish on bitcoin it's not
[00:17:14] the end of the world for some of the
[00:17:15] altcoin sector however you have to be
[00:17:18] very very careful with how you play the
[00:17:19] market in this type of environment
[00:17:21] because typically and the majority of
[00:17:24] the time uh altcoins move as a higher
[00:17:27] beta play compared to what bitcoin's
[00:17:29] moving at so if Bitcoin goes up 2%
[00:17:32] altcoins go up 5 to 10% if Bitcoin goes
[00:17:34] down 2% altcoins go down 5 to 10% but
[00:17:37] there is that spot within the market
[00:17:40] Cycles where there is this decorrelation
[00:17:43] and you see Bitcoin going down slowly in
[00:17:45] a controlled fashion specifically where
[00:17:48] then altcoins have this opportunity to
[00:17:51] Rally so 2025 will be really really
[00:17:54] telling uh what you can do as well if
[00:17:56] you haven't already you have just 48
[00:17:58] hours left to uh guess what the price of
[00:18:01] Bitcoin will be of course the fact that
[00:18:03] we're only 48 hours away from the yearly
[00:18:05] close um means you have a massive
[00:18:07] massive Edge over here to guess the
[00:18:09] price of Bitcoin if you guess the price
[00:18:11] of Bitcoin correctly um as per on
[00:18:15] coinbase as the clock strikes 12 on the
[00:18:17] 1st of January 2025 again 48 hours away
[00:18:21] you can win yourself an entire full
[00:18:23] Bitcoin you can see the majority of the
[00:18:25] guesses right now um are situated
[00:18:27] between this 9 8 and $99,000 Mark for
[00:18:31] the end of your close so you can put in
