[00:00:11] example of many and I'll will teach you
[00:00:12] exactly how you can do the same with

[00:00:31] my name is FAA I bring you the best
[00:00:32] offer in the crypto space from the TW
[00:00:34] past 24 hours all the news you need and
[00:00:36] the next 24 hours and then tutorials and
[00:00:38] tips and tricks like this so if you like
[00:00:40] this you can find me on X as well
[00:00:42] there's a link in the description this
[00:00:43] is my X profile let's get into it now
[00:00:46] the way I made $33,000 is quite simple
[00:00:49] you have two ways of trading right you
[00:00:51] can do ta which is technical analysis
[00:00:53] and then you can do fundamental analysis
[00:00:55] now for me my strength is rather ta but
[00:00:58] I'm moving more and more especially with
[00:01:00] the influence of Rand and moving more
[00:01:01] and more into fundamentals and trading
[00:01:04] based on fundamentals mixing and adding
[00:01:06] a little bit of ta Spice in there so the
[00:01:09] the big question is when you trade
[00:01:11] fundamentals where do you find the alpha
[00:01:13] like how do you actually know to buy
[00:01:16] into a token you read a news you don't
[00:01:17] know what that really means you don't
[00:01:18] know how to interpret it you don't
[00:01:20] really understand it and the best way to
[00:01:22] actually do it is to use a an aggregator
[00:01:25] of news but the aggregators that you can
[00:01:27] find out there the problem with them is
[00:01:28] that they take every bit of news it's
[00:01:30] not a filtered high quality feed it's
[00:01:33] you know plugged into different
[00:01:35] different uh uh um uh websites and news
[00:01:37] outlets and groups and whatever and then
[00:01:39] the aggregator just takes everything all
[00:01:41] at once and then you can read it in one
[00:01:42] feed now we have created a tool that is
[00:01:44] completely free to use and absolutely
[00:01:47] incredible bent bubbles you might have
[00:01:49] heard about it on our shows but I want
[00:01:52] to show you what the power really is
[00:01:54] with bent to Bubbles and how you can
[00:01:57] actually make money out of it so let's
[00:01:59] jump into
[00:02:00] number one very important before I jump
[00:02:03] into the show I wanted to just give a
[00:02:04] quick word to our sponsor they are they
[00:02:06] are my partners on the channel uh bitun
[00:02:09] the reason why I bring them for you
[00:02:11] every time I partner with the exchange I
[00:02:12] want them to give you guys a great deal
[00:02:14] so they are doing their non kyc
[00:02:16] available worldwide exchange and if you
[00:02:18] sign up you get a 20% deposit bonus that
[00:02:20] means if you sign up now using the link
[00:02:22] in the description I don't know how long
[00:02:23] the deal is open depending on when you
[00:02:24] watch the video but for the next 24 48
[00:02:26] hours this is definitely on if you sign
[00:02:28] up using my link in the subcription you
[00:02:30] get 20% deposit bonus on your deposit so
[00:02:34] if you deposit $1,000 you get $200 to
[00:02:36] trade with you can do whatever you want
[00:02:37] with it if you make a profit you can
[00:02:39] withdraw that if you deposit $2,000 you
[00:02:41] make $400 back you get the deal check
[00:02:43] them out in the description now when you
[00:02:46] understand how to trade when you know
[00:02:48] where to trade which is bit UN in my
[00:02:50] opinion at this time you need to
[00:02:52] understand how to trade it or what to
[00:02:53] trade now with B bubbles we created a
[00:02:56] tool that not only shows you the market
[00:02:58] real time in a very visual
[00:03:00] but also incorporate a lot of tips and
[00:03:02] tricks into the side very useful tools
[00:03:05] that you might not know about so in
[00:03:06] general very short tldd if you have not
[00:03:08] used bent bubbles yet it's a tool that
[00:03:10] shows you the market right now you can
[00:03:12] filter for hour you can filter for daily
[00:03:14] you can filter for weekly monthly yearly
[00:03:17] and then you have as as as the gains
[00:03:20] grow on the bubble virtual just came in
[00:03:21] like very close in here for me but um
[00:03:24] but if you know the more you you you use
[00:03:26] the tool or the more you you uh go up on
[00:03:29] a t frame the tool gives you more
[00:03:31] Bubbles and bigger bubbles so if there
[00:03:33] is bigger game there is bigger bubble
[00:03:35] and as you go down you will see that
[00:03:36] virtual only had a 400% run this month
[00:03:39] so the B bubble becomes much smaller
[00:03:41] other than the $8,000 in a year now this
[00:03:44] is the way you can filter and you can
[00:03:45] just see when you click on a bubble you
[00:03:47] can see a bunch of information hourly 4
[00:03:49] Hour one day one week one month one year
[00:03:51] gains you see the chart you see the
[00:03:53] market cap full Del valuation so you see
[00:03:55] every relevant information in here you
[00:03:57] can also tra see where you can trade it
[00:03:59] and if someone tags sui in our community
[00:04:02] which I'm going to talk about in a
[00:04:03] second you are able to see the feed here
[00:04:06] so if for example someone comes in here
[00:04:08] and they say Sue Network hit 7.5 billion
[00:04:10] transactions so you see that news you
[00:04:12] can go down and say you know someone tag
[00:04:14] backpack wallet and exchange ads support
[00:04:16] for sui so if someone tags suie in our
[00:04:19] news Group which again I'm going to talk
[00:04:20] about in a second is 60 researchers
[00:04:22] posting non con constant Alpha that is
[00:04:25] filtered high quality Alpha but if they
[00:04:27] tag it you can see it here so for
[00:04:28] example if I go on the hourly and I look
[00:04:31] at um let's look at s was a great
[00:04:33] example but let's look at Doge for
[00:04:34] example now this is the weekend when I'm
[00:04:37] recording this show so so there is not
[00:04:39] much happening here but even now you can
[00:04:42] see here for example on Doge you see an
[00:04:44] analysis on what you can expect from
[00:04:46] Doge from someone here you can see Doge
[00:04:48] Pepa and sheep all doing more volume
[00:04:50] than salana today despite being in some
[00:04:51] cases on10th of the market cap so like
[00:04:54] you can see you can see these different
[00:04:56] narratives and different posts coming in
[00:04:58] here and then you can also Che chat
[00:05:00] about uh you can also chat about the
[00:05:02] token in here now what are other tools
[00:05:06] you can use with bent bubbles for me
[00:05:08] personally I use for a couple of things
[00:05:10] the biggest thing and the way I also
[00:05:12] made a lot of money is through the news
[00:05:14] room on the top right corner you can see
[00:05:16] this Newsroom button here the way it
[00:05:18] works you immediately see my post
[00:05:20] because I posted in here but the way
[00:05:21] this Newsroom works is that it pops out
[00:05:23] here probably there will be a pop up at
[00:05:25] some point but it pops out here and you
[00:05:28] will be able to scroll a feed of
[00:05:30] information fed by handpicked
[00:05:34] researchers so we at bentor have 40 to
[00:05:37] 50 to 60 researchers depending on who is
[00:05:39] when where but we've got people who are
[00:05:41] plugged into the industry 24/7 and tweet
[00:05:44] into a WhatsApp group then then gets
[00:05:46] added here onto the feed now I
[00:05:49] personally prepare for every single show
[00:05:52] I make through this so I post a lot of
[00:05:55] things as well you see here for example
[00:05:56] this mind-blowing thing uh Tik Tok
[00:05:58] owners created an AI of himself and you
[00:06:00] can discuss with that AI just an AI
[00:06:01] agent AI agents are blowing up now but
[00:06:04] but you can get the latest information
[00:06:06] for example you might belonging Athena
[00:06:08] right and you can get here and you we
[00:06:10] will see o posted bitmax co-founder
[00:06:12] Arthur Hayes um on stake 9 million
[00:06:15] Athena and deposited onto binance so
[00:06:18] like you can take this information and
[00:06:20] interpret it in a way where okay if
[00:06:22] someone took 9 million uh uh uh Athena
[00:06:25] and deposited seven into binance there
[00:06:27] must be some kind of selling pressure
[00:06:29] coming now this is just one example but
[00:06:32] in general we have a bunch of discussion
[00:06:34] here so it's not only is so for example
[00:06:36] here uh kiwi says idea returns have
[00:06:38] significantly decreased by 40 54.9% from
[00:06:41] last week comparing the top five
[00:06:43] launches of uh each respective week
[00:06:46] there was no rep so for example for
[00:06:47] example there are discussions here right
[00:06:49] so so Jay here the Irish man here just
[00:06:53] posted and he said send it to 50 he
[00:06:55] posted this hype token at $5 into The
[00:06:58] Newsroom here this is the trade that I
[00:06:59] actually didn't take but but he posted
[00:07:03] the trade here at $5 and called for it
[00:07:05] to go higher $5 guys six seven X's ago
[00:07:09] and then now he's calling for 50 and
[00:07:11] then obviously we have back and forth
[00:07:12] about it so The Newsroom is one of the
[00:07:15] most powerful tools on bent to Bubbles
[00:07:17] now how did I make money it's very
[00:07:19] simple when there was a listing
[00:07:20] happening someone at The Newsroom
[00:07:23] someone at The Newsroom posted that the
[00:07:24] valuation of the listing was not right
[00:07:26] it should be double so I actually longed
[00:07:29] uh I actually longed based on that news
[00:07:31] and I made $3,000 from actually made
[00:07:33] 100% on 10x leverage so pump 10%
[00:07:35] immediately after listing because the
[00:07:37] valuation it was listed at was not right
[00:07:39] so it's that simple you just have to
[00:07:41] monitor this now you might be wondering
[00:07:42] you can see at the at the screen at all
[00:07:44] times and what you going to do and this
[00:07:46] is where the mobile app comes in very
[00:07:47] handy so we do have a mobile app which
[00:07:49] is very very similar so you have the
[00:07:51] mobile app in here you have the settings
[00:07:53] you have the chat as well which is quite
[00:07:54] cool this is a general General chat but
[00:07:57] if you go down here there is this little
[00:07:58] fire icon is literally just right there
[00:08:01] so this fire icon is The Newsroom so
[00:08:04] when you come here you will be able to
[00:08:06] just scroll this now I personally
[00:08:07] recommend you don't have a lot of time
[00:08:10] you just simply do not have a time to to
[00:08:13] to waste especially when it comes to to
[00:08:16] um to um uh to when it comes to the next
[00:08:20] six months you don't have time to waste
[00:08:21] when it comes to the next six months why
[00:08:23] because the bull market is here so if
[00:08:25] you want to capitalize on the bull
[00:08:26] market I personally would recommend that
[00:08:28] you start this seriously and instead of
[00:08:30] scrolling YouTube and instead of
[00:08:32] scrolling uh look I posted this here for
[00:08:34] example so so when when when instead of
[00:08:37] scrolling um uh Instagram and instead of
[00:08:39] scrolling scrolling uh YouTube I would
[00:08:42] recommend you scroll this every single
[00:08:44] time when you touch your phone this
[00:08:45] should be the first thing that comes up
[00:08:47] and you scroll this should be the first
[00:08:48] thing that you do you look at it you
[00:08:50] scroll through you see what is happening
[00:08:52] and from there you can make money but I
[00:08:53] wanted to show you another features that
[00:08:56] I actually personally use banter bubbles
[00:08:58] for trading oh by the way there is a
[00:08:59] winner Bitcoin option so it's completely
[00:09:01] free as well by the way everything I
[00:09:02] showed you is completely free there is
[00:09:04] nothing like this on the market where
[00:09:05] you get access to 60 researchers and you
[00:09:07] can chat in the community chat it's just
[00:09:09] crazy anyway so what you can do is that
[00:09:12] you have to predict the price of Bitcoin
[00:09:15] by January 1st 2025 based on the
[00:09:17] coinbase pricing okay so predict the
[00:09:19] price of Bitcoin on coinbase by January
[00:09:21] 1st 2025 midnight EST so if you you the
[00:09:25] way to do it is very simple there are
[00:09:27] these Exchange accounts you can use my
[00:09:28] Exchange accounts in the description as
[00:09:30] well you can simply sign up to an
[00:09:31] exchange and you have your referral ID
[00:09:34] and you click here to ready you pick the
[00:09:35] exchange that you sign up using my link
[00:09:37] in the description you say what your
[00:09:38] prediction is let's say
[00:09:40] $102,000 and then you can say your
[00:09:42] account number whatever your account
[00:09:44] number is and then you can click on sign
[00:09:47] in you have to sign in and simply using
[00:09:50] your email or connecting your X
[00:09:52] whichever you prefer and then you are in
[00:09:55] the raffle if you used our exchange
[00:09:58] account you have a shot at winning one
[00:10:00] Bitcoin depending on whether you got the
[00:10:03] price right so if you are the closest to
[00:10:05] the real price on January 1st you win
[00:10:08] half Bitcoin and if you traded 10 times
[00:10:10] using the links in the description you
[00:10:12] can win a whole Bitcoin now let me show
[00:10:14] you some other tools which is which is
[00:10:16] pretty cool here one is you can filter
[00:10:18] so you can click on here on the filter
[00:10:20] button this little plus icon and you can
[00:10:22] filter for 1 minute 5 minute 15 minute
[00:10:24] you can create based on price market cap
[00:10:26] volume what do want what do you want the
[00:10:28] the the the bubbles to be sized based on
[00:10:32] here's what is pretty cool if you go
[00:10:33] into one minute first of all it adds
[00:10:35] this filter but second most importantly
[00:10:37] you will be able to see how the bubbles
[00:10:41] update so now it's it's very Dynamic
[00:10:44] it's not like it's being where it had to
[00:10:46] refresh the page and whatever now the
[00:10:48] bubbles update real time it's just so
[00:10:51] cool so we actually have this on the
[00:10:52] screen here at all times we just look at
[00:10:54] them and we see how they perform but
[00:10:56] it's not only it's not only the doll
[00:10:59] that I'm actually looking at it's also
[00:11:00] the Bitcoin so if you come up here
[00:11:02] there's a Bitcoin you see it's even set
[00:11:03] to Bitcoin now but what I'm looking at
[00:11:06] you can pick the US dollar and you can
[00:11:08] see how much these tokens increased in
[00:11:10] dollar value that's interesting but
[00:11:13] especially as all season comes what you
[00:11:15] really want to focus on is you want to
[00:11:18] focus on um you want to focus on
[00:11:20] relative strength compared to bitcoin
[00:11:22] you want to see what outperforms Bitcoin
[00:11:25] in what scale so if you see here you
[00:11:27] click on US dollar you have most of the
[00:11:29] screen because the tokens are going up
[00:11:31] in value but if you click on bitcoin you
[00:11:33] will see that Bitcoin is still very
[00:11:35] strong and most of the coins that are
[00:11:37] performing well in doar dollar value do
[00:11:40] not outperform Bitcoin so what you can
[00:11:43] do is you can look at agent you can look
[00:11:45] at AR you can look at bitat token you
[00:11:48] can look at all these tokens and be like
[00:11:50] what has relative strength compared to
[00:11:52] bitcoin you can look at it on the daily
[00:11:54] for example you can see sui relative
[00:11:56] strength to bitcoin is strong apas if
[00:11:58] you look at apas here you can go on to
[00:12:00] the dollar and you can see Aptos is up
[00:12:02] about uh about down about 6% but if you
[00:12:05] measure it against Bitcoin it's actually
[00:12:06] down about 8% today so there is a big
[00:12:09] difference so from this you can
[00:12:11] immediately see if you if you create a
[00:12:13] filter for example 5 minute and you
[00:12:15] filterate for Bitcoin you will be able
[00:12:17] to see what has relative strength and
[00:12:19] what increas is quite cool and that's
[00:12:21] how you can actually take your own
[00:12:23] trades you see I'm going to show you on
[00:12:24] the on the a minute as well the
[00:12:26] difference between between the drops and
[00:12:27] between the increases between bit and
[00:12:29] and US dollar so that's one thing and
[00:12:32] then if you of course if you come here
[00:12:33] you will be able to see the language
[00:12:34] settings so we have a bunch of languages
[00:12:37] Italian Filipino so we have all these we
[00:12:40] have all these languages over here you
[00:12:41] can set the currency so you might want
[00:12:43] to see your your bag in Bitcoin or you
[00:12:45] might want to see your bag in in in
[00:12:47] Euros so you can set your currency once
[00:12:49] you set your portfolio as well you can
[00:12:51] show and hide stable coins so obviously
[00:12:53] you don't necessarily want to see uh
[00:12:55] stable coins um on here so you can hide
[00:12:57] and show them then you can have a
[00:12:59] favorite list so you can just pick and
[00:13:00] add the bubbles that you want in your
[00:13:02] favorite and then you will always have a
[00:13:04] favorite to go to so you can just toggle
[00:13:05] in here and this is the last thing that
[00:13:07] I wanted to show you which is you can
[00:13:08] search for different categories so you
[00:13:10] can search for one top one to 100 in
[00:13:13] market cap 101 to 200 market cap and you
[00:13:16] can also look for ecosystems you can so
[00:13:18] for example I click on ethereum these
[00:13:19] are all the ethereum tokens or you can
[00:13:21] look at uh let's say soul these are the
[00:13:24] soul tokens so you can look at all these
[00:13:27] you can see them update you can look at
[00:13:28] it on the daily
[00:13:29] cat is Cat is
[00:13:31] 1,171 have you seen that cat Simon's Cat
[00:13:34] went 1,1 crazy I call this they were our
[00:13:37] partners on the channel so all of you
[00:13:39] are hating on the sponsors and oh it's a
[00:13:41] sponsor plug whatever I call this a 200
[00:13:43] what is the now uh full fdv what is this
[00:13:47] this is not right this must be must not
[00:13:49] be right 300 mil oh maybe it is right
[00:13:52] maybe it is then I called it at 20
[00:13:54] something I don't know I don't know but
