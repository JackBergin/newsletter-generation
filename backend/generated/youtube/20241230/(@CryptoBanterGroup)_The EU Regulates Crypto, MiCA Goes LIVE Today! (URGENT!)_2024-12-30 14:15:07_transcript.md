[00:00:01] what's up fam welcome back to the show
[00:00:04] today is the big day because Mika the
[00:00:06] regulation in the European Union comes
[00:00:08] to effect today and it seems like
[00:00:10] everybody's panicking and usdt is going
[00:00:12] to go to zero and and you know people
[00:00:14] are going nuts about this and and they
[00:00:16] think that the world is ending and the
[00:00:17] th fod in and of itself is something
[00:00:19] that's been going around for ages and
[00:00:21] ages and ages but anyway we're going to
[00:00:23] talk about why we are actually not
[00:00:24] screwed with this whole MAA and EU
[00:00:27] regulation I'm going to explain to you
[00:00:28] what is it exactly and what will happen
[00:00:30] happen from today on I'm also going to
[00:00:32] talk about a bunch of other stuff as I
[00:00:33] always do recent news for example

[00:00:38] you be trading on or what could be the
[00:00:40] opportunity here 5 to 10x meme
[00:00:42] opportunities we're going to talk about
[00:00:43] how China found 1,000 ton of gold holy
[00:00:46] [ __ ] which is about 0.5% of the supply
[00:00:49] going to talk about the implications on
[00:00:50] that and also I'm going to talk about
[00:00:52] whether you should start rotating into
[00:00:54] eth or not or is it time to start

[00:01:29] get going here all right so guys number
[00:01:34] one MAA let's let's run through first of
[00:01:37] all I'm actually freaking impressed like
[00:01:39] this is my first ever tweet that got
[00:01:41] 500,000 Impressions which is I'm super
[00:01:44] happy about this like it's you know it's
[00:01:46] like a big thing for me so we're going
[00:01:47] to start focusing much more on these
[00:01:49] threads I genuinely thought these were
[00:01:50] kind of obvious for people but but uh
[00:01:53] Ian not necessar Mika but in general so
[00:01:55] but I'm going to focus much more on
[00:01:56] writing threads but Mika is Market in
[00:02:00] crypto asset regulations so if you're
[00:02:01] not in the EU or if you're in the EU and
[00:02:03] I don't know very simply there was this
[00:02:05] proposal put forward few years back uh
[00:02:08] that was about regulating crypto
[00:02:11] exchanges crypto assets and stable coin
[00:02:13] stable coin issuers everything about
[00:02:15] crypto how could they make crypto safer
[00:02:18] in the EU and I know what you're
[00:02:19] thinking you're like oh my God this
[00:02:21] [ __ ] you know but but in general this
[00:02:23] is actually a good thing because they
[00:02:25] are making crypto safer so the whole
[00:02:27] idea whether they're you know they're on
[00:02:29] track or not we're going to talk about
[00:02:30] in a second but but the whole idea
[00:02:32] behind m is not something that you know
[00:02:35] uh the EU is hating on crypto and the EU
[00:02:37] wants to crack down I see all these
[00:02:39] crazy headlines and Twitter posts and
[00:02:40] I'm like it really just causes
[00:02:42] unnecessary fud uh around the market so
[00:02:45] so there's nothing like that everything
[00:02:47] is fine it's been planned for a long
[00:02:49] time it's not a Crackdown from the EU
[00:02:51] it's very simply put a regulatory
[00:02:54] framework that outlines how exchanges
[00:02:57] stable coins stable coin issuers crypto
[00:03:00] projects can operate within the space
[00:03:02] which is good because one thing the
[00:03:04] markets don't like is uncertainty and
[00:03:06] with MAA in the EU they are going to
[00:03:08] have certainty okay or much more
[00:03:10] certainty than they had previously I
[00:03:12] wrote this complete thread there's a
[00:03:13] link in the description to my to my X
[00:03:15] profile if you go down it's going to be
[00:03:16] here follow FFA on X for Daily Alpha you
[00:03:19] can do that and you can uh find these uh
[00:03:22] po posts as well but you can read it
[00:03:24] through but I'm going to run through
[00:03:25] here now first of all obviously not
[00:03:26] disclosure anything I say on the show as
[00:03:27] well is not Financial advice I'm just
[00:03:29] going to share my thoughts but what is M
[00:03:31] Mika is a market in crypto asset
[00:03:33] regulation and EU framework launching on
[00:03:35] December 13th which is today and the
[00:03:37] whole idea is to one protect investors
[00:03:39] two regulate stable coins and three
[00:03:41] licensed crypto providers whether they
[00:03:43] are vendors exchanges much more now
[00:03:46] under this regulatory uh uh regulatory
[00:03:49] um uh framework these companies that
[00:03:51] want to operate within the EU or want to
[00:03:55] offer their products to the EU so they
[00:03:57] can be a company outside of the EU this
[00:03:59] is also a misconception or a
[00:04:01] misunderstanding that it doesn't have to
[00:04:03] be an EU based company it has to be a
[00:04:05] company that offers services to EU
[00:04:08] residents will need to get this m
[00:04:10] license again we're talking about crypto
[00:04:11] so they need need to get this m license
[00:04:14] and especially when when it comes to
[00:04:16] stable coin providers obviously probably
[00:04:18] I believe they want to do you know Euro
[00:04:20] stable coin or whatever and they want to
[00:04:21] limit who and how can operate Within
[00:04:23] These boundaries so if you do that if
[00:04:26] you look through what stable coins you
[00:04:28] already have you have theter and you
[00:04:29] usdc as the two major ones usdc is
[00:04:32] issued by Circle a company called Circle
[00:04:34] and circle is licensed so they already
[00:04:37] have uh a license for usdc they're also
[00:04:39] going to have USD uh as Euro but USD
[00:04:43] Circle Euro but but now they have the
[00:04:46] USD uh uh usdc a stable coin and they
[00:04:50] have a license to operate within the EU
[00:04:53] I got it that okay so so so that means
[00:04:55] that even if usdt which is actually not
[00:04:57] rense I'm going to talk about it in a
[00:04:58] second is not license you will still be
[00:05:01] able to do crypto transactions on major
[00:05:03] platforms like binance like bybit like
[00:05:05] all the other platforms that will limit
[00:05:07] the use of usdt if they will limit so
[00:05:10] the fact is that yes you need regulation
[00:05:12] and usdc or circle is already licensed
[00:05:15] so so so there's no reason to believe
[00:05:17] that crypto is going to stop existing
[00:05:19] you will not be able to sell your crypto
[00:05:20] all that theter on the other hand and
[00:05:22] all this thought about theter yes about
[00:05:24] 67% and I also WR it here in the thread
[00:05:26] about 67% of all transactions are based
[00:05:29] on theter or R connected goes through
[00:05:31] theter so obviously if theter would be
[00:05:34] banned in the EU it would be bad for the
[00:05:36] industry but that's not necessarily the
[00:05:39] case now theer the iser usdt is not
[00:05:43] licensed and does not plan to do any
[00:05:45] license for ma okay now there are talks
[00:05:48] that they are going to have a Euro
[00:05:50] stable coin and that will be licensed
[00:05:52] and there's like a lot of talks around
[00:05:54] that but one thing is for certain that
[00:05:56] they are not licensed for Ma and they
[00:05:58] are not planning to be licensed for usdt
[00:06:01] okay now even though that t and and I
[00:06:04] write it here even though that they are
[00:06:06] not licensed this does not mean that
[00:06:09] usdt is unsafe so all of the people go
[00:06:11] around and they say oh my God usdt is
[00:06:13] going to collapse and usdt is going to
[00:06:15] die and this and this and this none of
[00:06:17] that is true none of that is true or not
[00:06:19] because of the Miko not because the fact
[00:06:22] that they are not licensed doesn't mean
[00:06:24] that you can't use them on chain it
[00:06:26] doesn't mean that you can't use them on
[00:06:27] nonky exchanges it doesn't mean that you
[00:06:29] can't use them anywhere else other than
[00:06:31] the EU it just means that for a certain
[00:06:34] time and I'm going to talk about the
[00:06:35] period you might have limited access to
[00:06:38] usdt if the companies that are providers
[00:06:41] for example binance already announced
[00:06:42] that they are not going to use usdt will
[00:06:45] announce they're not going to use usdt
[00:06:47] you will just have to use another issuer
[00:06:49] now let me scroll through here what
[00:06:51] should you do okay so number one do
[00:06:54] nothing honestly do nothing what you can
[00:06:56] potentially do is you can com one thing
[00:06:59] you should do is to look through your
[00:07:01] Exchange accounts and see like okay is
[00:07:02] there any exchange that deist usdt but
[00:07:05] even if you don't do anything they will
[00:07:06] just simply convert Your usdt Balanced
[00:07:08] one one onto usdc or the stable coin
[00:07:11] that they're going to to uh uh to
[00:07:13] support probably is going to be usdc
[00:07:15] because of circle's license uh but there
[00:07:18] is everything is going to be done in the
[00:07:19] background even if you don't do anything
[00:07:21] what you can potentially do is you can
[00:07:24] look into the the uh hold on a second
[00:07:27] what you can potentially do where is it
[00:07:29] what you can can potentially do is you
[00:07:30] can look into how you can if for example
[00:07:33] there was an exchange that's that for
[00:07:34] example binance announces that they are
[00:07:36] not going to support usdt you can try to
[00:07:38] play around the fact when do you convert
[00:07:40] your usdt you can try to play around the
[00:07:42] fact that you obviously have to close
[00:07:43] your leverage positions which are usdt
[00:07:46] and then convert that into usdc and
[00:07:48] potentially move your funds into usdc on
[00:07:50] your leverage account but in general
[00:07:52] there is not much to do uh that's
[00:07:55] basically basically the whole thing
[00:07:57] behind there is one more very important
[00:07:59] aspect to it yes which I almost forget
[00:08:01] one very very important aspect to it is
[00:08:03] that although it comes into effect today
[00:08:06] so from today December 13th 2024 you do
[00:08:09] have the M regulation going live but
[00:08:12] there is a six months window that allows
[00:08:14] companies to catch up on this m
[00:08:17] regulation and get acquire licenses now
[00:08:20] until there is an acceptance or
[00:08:23] rejection of the license that the
[00:08:25] companies apply for they can still
[00:08:27] operate Within These 6 months period now
[00:08:29] this six-month period lasts from today
[00:08:31] until July 1st I think it's j July 1st
[00:08:34] 20 what do it say here yeah July 1st
[00:08:37] okay so it's July 1st 2025 and then
[00:08:41] there is an extension opportunity which
[00:08:43] I'm pretty sure that crypto companies
[00:08:44] will find a way to do then you can
[00:08:46] extend that until July 1st
[00:08:49] 2026 so that's an 18 month period so
[00:08:52] even if usdt or tedar does not acquire a
[00:08:55] license does not issue a new coin y even
[00:08:58] though they don't do that that they have
[00:09:00] a six month window to operate so it's
[00:09:01] going to be interesting topic again on
[00:09:03] July 1st 2025 but until then there is
[00:09:06] not much to do the tldr is m is
[00:09:09] launching mik is good for everybody
[00:09:12] chill the F out and stop spreading fud
[00:09:14] Terror has been fed so many times not
[00:09:15] going to not going to go under most
[00:09:17] likely obviously nobody knows but it's
[00:09:18] not going to be like oh my God that is
[00:09:20] ending because of mik mik seems like a
[00:09:22] pain in the ass but significantly step
[00:09:24] towards Global crypto Clarity and in my
[00:09:26] honest opinion will be good for the
[00:09:28] industry long term and exchanges and
[00:09:30] providers issuers have another six to 18
[00:09:32] months to get compant so that's about
[00:09:34] Mika okay let's get that out of the
[00:09:35] window I'm happy that everybody
[00:09:37] understands this if you got any
[00:09:38] questions I'm here in the comments so
[00:09:39] please just let me know in the comment
[00:09:41] section I'm going to reply uh but in
[00:09:43] general that's basically it and why
[00:09:44] everybody is panicking everybody's going
[00:09:46] nuts and oh my God mik and the world is
[00:09:49] ending someone is buying someone put
[00:09:53] $255 Million worth of bitcoin two and a
[00:09:57] 2.7 th000 Bitcoin why everybody's
[00:09:59] panicking this is a whale it's not like
[00:10:02] a random you know group of people
[00:10:03] whatever we don't know but someone
[00:10:05] bought 2.7 th000 Bitcoin 255 million
[00:10:09] worth of Bitcoins and it's not only them
[00:10:11] the ETFs in the US bought about 50, 49,5
[00:10:15] 91 Bitcoins in December but the
[00:10:18] important number here is not the 50,000
[00:10:21] Bitcoins the important number here is
[00:10:23] the
[00:10:25] 13,500 that's the amount of Bitcoins
[00:10:27] that been been been mined in December as
[00:10:30] opposed to only the ETF purchases which
[00:10:34] was 50,000 that's about four times the
[00:10:38] amount of Bitcoin that's been bought
[00:10:40] than the Bitcoin that's been mined and
[00:10:42] this is where it really gets interesting
[00:10:43] because the game theory is supply and
[00:10:45] demand the reason why price goes up in
[00:10:48] everything or anything is because of
[00:10:50] supply and demand if there is not enough
[00:10:52] Supply and enough big demand big enough
[00:10:55] demand the price will obviously go
[00:10:57] higher if there is 50 people that want
[00:10:59] to buy this little toy here for $10
[00:11:02] someone will say you know what I'm going
[00:11:03] to give you $12 for it and then someone
[00:11:05] will say oh holy [ __ ] can I just bid
[00:11:06] well I'm going to bid 14 because I need
[00:11:08] it and then the price starts going up
[00:11:10] because there's increas increased um uh
[00:11:13] demand and limited Supply it's only one
[00:11:15] we're only 21
[00:11:16] million now do not bet against 2020 uh
[00:11:21] 2025 q1 I know that all of you are
[00:11:24] scared I know that some of you think oh
[00:11:26] my God I'm going to you know going to
[00:11:28] wreck myself and I'm I'm being stupid
[00:11:30] maybe you bought the top maybe you
[00:11:31] bought the top of this dip and um maybe
[00:11:34] you didn't follow me on X and you didn't
[00:11:35] get the noty you should start taking
[00:11:37] profits but if you haven't well this is
[00:11:39] a great opportunity and if you have do
[00:11:41] not panic okay do not panic it's being
[00:11:44] like this a dedicated my entire life on
[00:11:46] helping you guys navigate the market
[00:11:47] because I've been there I have been the
[00:11:50] one sitting there thinking holy [ __ ]
[00:11:51] what have I done and I've made all the
[00:11:54] mistakes in the book do not and I
[00:11:57] emphasize it do not quit now do not say
[00:12:01] I I seen people send me DMs I read every
[00:12:03] DM and I reply to the ones that make any
[00:12:05] sense and people are like I'm going to
[00:12:07] just cut my positions like I'm down 50%
[00:12:10] I'm just going to sell every close
[00:12:11] everything now because probably the bull
[00:12:12] market is ended don't don't be that guy
[00:12:16] okay obviously not Financial advice you
[00:12:17] do whatever you want to do but I've made
[00:12:18] this mistake and I really regretted it
[00:12:21] so q1 after the holing year has always
[00:12:25] been extremely bullish if you look at
[00:12:26] 2017 one year after the Hing 31% in
[00:12:30] January alone 48% in February
[00:12:34] 214% in March okay 2021 78% on January
[00:12:39] loan 8% in February 34 in March 44 in
[00:12:42] April we're looking at a massive
[00:12:44] freaking explosive growth maybe we're
[00:12:46] going to have and I'm going to talk
[00:12:47] about it in a second maybe we're going
[00:12:48] to have a little more downside but on
[00:12:50] the grand scheme of things this is the
[00:12:52] time to start bidding this is the time
[00:12:54] to go all in all in because the next
[00:12:57] three to four to five months is going to
[00:12:58] be
[00:12:59] exponential now four and eight years ago
[00:13:02] you've seen the Hallen Cycles we have
[00:13:03] talked about it quite some times already
[00:13:06] uh on the show but in general what you
[00:13:07] can see here is the blue line it's the
[00:13:10] scale represents the the the scale
[00:13:12] compared to different holing Cycles
[00:13:14] right uh if you see the 20 20 uh 2014
[00:13:17] 2017 cycle down here with the blue 2018
[00:13:20] 2021 is the gold and 2022 2025 is the
[00:13:23] black one now you see we have met It
[00:13:26] Whatever the number might be we might
[00:13:28] not go up to a million we might not go
[00:13:29] up to 500,000 but there is another
[00:13:32] problem coming and it's only Bitcoin
[00:13:33] that we're looking at there is another
[00:13:35] problem coming on on on on crypto in
[00:13:38] general and this is the life changing
[00:13:40] opportunity in the next four months
[00:13:42] you'll be able to make 3 to 5x easy with
[00:13:45] the biggest assets as well if you buy
[00:13:46] salano today it's an easy 3 to 5x in my
[00:13:49] opinion if you buy ethereum it's an easy
[00:13:51] 2x if you buy Bitcoin it's an easy 80%
[00:13:54] in my opinion you know even more
[00:13:56] possibly even more so so just want to
[00:13:59] just want to emphasize this and and as
[00:14:01] Alex Becker says here it's incredibly
[00:14:03] obvious the market is about to Surge
[00:14:05] unless you're a dumb effing [ __ ] midi
[00:14:07] pod mod person okay so I just wanted to
[00:14:10] put it out here but I have a better
[00:14:11] explanation so I wrote this threat today
[00:14:14] and I said read this and I want to read
[00:14:16] this to you as well if you if you
[00:14:17] haven't followed me or if you haven't
[00:14:18] seen this it's important just want to
[00:14:20] make sure I'm crystal clear on my
[00:14:22] Approach so you do not miss the biggest
[00:14:23] bump of the decade it's important I post
[00:14:26] intraday trades I post charts and
[00:14:27] whatnot so just wanted to make sure that
[00:14:29] it's very clear on where I stand I am
[00:14:32] heavy long heavy long on 3 to 5x
[00:14:35] leverage positions about 60 70% deployed
[00:14:37] meaning about 60 to 70% of my cash that
[00:14:39] is allocated for leverage trading is
[00:14:41] already in the market and about 30 40 30
[00:14:44] 40% is waiting for the dip if the dip
[00:14:46] comes and there can be extremely extreme
[00:14:48] volatility in the next two weeks one
[00:14:51] there is the yearly and monthly close so
[00:14:53] we have monthly closes and usually these
[00:14:55] periods are very volatile but now we
[00:14:57] spice it up a little bit with the yearly
[00:14:59] close coming tomorrow the yearly CL will
[00:15:01] close Trump trump Trump trump
[00:15:03] inauguration coming next year uh next
[00:15:06] year January 20th so that's also
[00:15:09] something obviously inauguration is
[00:15:10] uncertainty in the markets we need to
[00:15:12] see how the market responds massive
[00:15:14] liquidity and imbalance to the down side
[00:15:15] ta says we technical analysis says we're
[00:15:17] going to dump and inflation fed
[00:15:19] uncertainty so we still have a little
[00:15:20] bit of uncertainty regarding inflation
[00:15:22] what will the FED do in January like
[00:15:24] there's a lot of questions still
[00:15:25] overhanging but I post my charts to keep
[00:15:28] you posted and protect you from doing
[00:15:29] something stupid even though I think
[00:15:31] we'll P dump it's not worth waiting Okay
[00:15:36] the reason why I'm being so vocal about
[00:15:38] this now because again I have been where
[00:15:41] you are I've been sitting there and I've
[00:15:45] been thinking to myself what the [ __ ]
[00:15:46] should I do and I'm telling you not
[00:15:49] Financial advice but
[00:15:51] deploy
[00:15:52] deploy protect your downside very
[00:15:55] important don't do 20x leverage in a
[00:15:57] meme coin don't do that be able to
[00:15:59] weather a 20 30% drop on major coins
[00:16:02] there is a possibility salana drops down
[00:16:03] to 150 140 there is it is possible there
[00:16:06] is a possibility Bitcoin goes down to
[00:16:08] 80,000
[00:16:09] 85,000 make sure that you can protect
[00:16:11] yourself if you're on Leverage make sure
[00:16:13] that your liquidation price is not
[00:16:14] existence there is no liquidation price
[00:16:16] add margin don't add that much amount of
[00:16:18] money into the position from your own
[00:16:20] money don't use high leverage make sure
[00:16:22] that you protect your downside and
[00:16:24] buckle the F up because I promise you
[00:16:27] the next three to six months it's going
[00:16:29] to be messy let's look at the charts and
[00:16:30] I have some crazy other news uh as well
[00:16:34] let's look at the charts here I know
[00:16:35] this sounds kind of kind of ludicrous
[00:16:38] this but here's what I posted so I said
[00:16:40] that we do have double tops here even if
[00:16:43] if if a dump is coming I think there is
[00:16:45] still a possibility for a massive dump
[00:16:47] down to the 2.95 trillion region the
[00:16:49] reason is if you follow my content again
[00:16:52] if you don't you should but I always
[00:16:54] talk about the 50% on the market 50%
[00:16:56] means markets always retrace 50% it has
[00:16:59] happened 20 all the bull markets
[00:17:01] everything if you look at lower time
[00:17:02] frame if you look at higher time frame
[00:17:04] I've been saying the same thing on the
[00:17:05] shows all the way up here and people
[00:17:07] said I'm an idiot and I said you know
[00:17:09] every time Marcus retrace 50% if you
[00:17:11] pull the 50% where did the market come
[00:17:13] it came 50% retrace it moved on so the
[00:17:15] 50% currently sits on this lag sits
[00:17:18] about 2.95 trillion on the total market
[00:17:20] cap and down here about 2.7 trillion
[00:17:23] that would be about between 77 and
[00:17:25] $85,000 Bitcoin going to look at the
[00:17:26] Bitcoin chart as well
[00:17:29] so on bitcoin if you look here uh uh uh
[00:17:31] it would be on this lag on this lag it
[00:17:34] would be down about 87 to
[00:17:37] 85,000 and if you pull it from the very
[00:17:39] bottom it's about 77,000 is for uh for
[00:17:42] the retrace this is absolute if we would
[00:17:45] do that that would be absolutely healthy
[00:17:48] it would be healthy simple healthy great
[00:17:50] so there is a possibility for us to dump
[00:17:52] from here that means that a potential 10
[00:17:54] 15% on on on major coins 20% on major
[00:17:57] coins is absolutely in the car
[00:17:59] but what I do believe is going to happen
[00:18:02] before we do that though is that we are
[00:18:04] going to take this liquidity here we're
[00:18:05] probably going to come up to the 3.43
[00:18:07] trillion is region up here and then
[00:18:10] reject come down this is where everybody
[00:18:12] gives in they're like okay the final
[00:18:13] pump was done D that's when we deploy
[00:18:16] like crazy and then we just move on if
[00:18:18] if if we don't come up to the 3.44
[00:18:21] trillion just add I'm already long I
[00:18:23] told you I'm heavy long my positions are
[00:18:24] underwat but it's fine because I plan
[00:18:27] the trade and I trade the plan and my
[00:18:29] plan is that I can be on the water for
[00:18:30] months before I because because I have
[00:18:32] the luxury of the bull market and I
[00:18:34] understand the market is going to up so
[00:18:36] even a monkey can trade in these
[00:18:38] conditions by the way just so you know
[00:18:39] so anyway so you come up if we come up
[00:18:42] to this 3.45 trillion region and I see a
[00:18:45] market structure shift which is a lower
[00:18:47] time frame Market structure Market
[00:18:49] structure shift lower low on the
[00:18:51] 15-minute chart in the hourly chart I
[00:18:54] will take some profits on the positions
[00:18:55] that I layered in here why because I do
[00:18:58] believe that we going to come down to
[00:18:59] the 2.95 trillion region okay so if this
[00:19:02] happens first I might consider taking
[00:19:04] some profits I'm going to update you on
[00:19:05] my ax I'm going to update you on on on
[00:19:07] YouTube um but there's the plan if we
[00:19:09] just start dumping here just add just
[00:19:11] add add to your positions because every
[00:19:14] five six 7% add a portion of the
[00:19:17] positions because these are the these
[00:19:19] are the life change this is where
[00:19:20] generational wealth is made okay um if
[00:19:23] you want a great trading platform bitx
[00:19:26] is the place they are Partners on the

[00:20:17] no-brainer to do that there's a link in
[00:20:18] the description bit uni make sure to
[00:20:20] check them out let me talk about some
[00:20:23] random news let's jump in here because
[00:20:25] and then we're going to look at some
[00:20:26] other charts as well but something
[00:20:28] interesting stuff is happening one is
[00:20:30] $16 billion in cash will be distributed
[00:20:33] start distributed by FTX s backman freed
[00:20:37] if you have not been here FTX was one of
[00:20:39] the biggest biggest frauds in crypto
[00:20:42] history uh there was a guy called Sam
[00:20:44] bankman freed who who who scammed
[00:20:46] everyone you deposited and there was no
[00:20:48] money on the exchange it was like a big
[00:20:49] ass sponsy and and and and because of
[00:20:52] the market because as the market
[00:20:54] recovered uh uh the the the
[00:20:58] the uh bankruptcy I don't know how they
[00:21:01] call I don't I can't remember how they
[00:21:02] call the the guy who actually arranges
[00:21:04] all the bankruptcies but anyway so they
[00:21:06] could recover about 130 trusty I think
[00:21:08] anyway they could recover 130% of the
[00:21:11] Lost funds because the market went up
[00:21:13] and they liquidated the tokens late or
[00:21:14] whatever now it's nothing because if you
[00:21:16] held coins on FTX they' probably be like
[00:21:18] 5x but now still they are going to
[00:21:21] distribute $6 billion in dollars now
[00:21:24] everybody is bullish on the fact that
[00:21:25] there's going to be dollars and every
[00:21:26] the $6 billion dollar is going to
[00:21:28] straight into crypto yes probably a
[00:21:31] portion of that will but if someone
[00:21:33] tells you that it's $16 billion coming
[00:21:35] into crypto no that's not true no
[00:21:37] because there will be people who burnt
[00:21:39] themselves institutions high stake
[00:21:41] investors who already you know they had
[00:21:43] maybe 2% of their wealth in crypto they
[00:21:44] held it on FTX when FTX collapsed the
[00:21:47] market collaps they probably bought
[00:21:48] another 2% of their wealth and then now
[00:21:49] they just getting back the money it's
[00:21:51] not all the money that is going to go
[00:21:52] into the market but it's definitely a
[00:21:54] very very bullish news on another news a
[00:21:57] AI xbt becomes the first AI agent to
[00:22:00] wear an
[00:22:02] ordinal S profile picture why is this
[00:22:05] interesting because again if you follow
[00:22:06] my content you know that I'm big ass on
[00:22:08] ordinals like I I became an nft
[00:22:10] evangelist I'm ordinals nft evangelist
[00:22:14] that's what I am okay so there is this
[00:22:17] this uh AI agent who's been pinged by
[00:22:20] this guy UD right and he said you seem
[00:22:22] to be bullish on Quantum cats which is
[00:22:25] like an ordinals nft this is how it
[00:22:26] looks uh I do not own any of these by
[00:22:29] the way they are like 0.35 Bitcoin which
[00:22:31] is quite quite expensive for the average
[00:22:33] people I think it's uh quite expensive
[00:22:35] and you really need to make sure that
[00:22:36] you buy stuff that is that is uh that is
[00:22:39] relevant I'm going to talk about that in
[00:22:39] a second but in general but in general
[00:22:43] uh what happened is that they sent an
[00:22:44] nft to this guy and then he he or this
[00:22:47] AI agent and then this AI agent used it
[00:22:50] as his profile picture which which is
[00:22:52] quite cool honestly it's actually quite
[00:22:55] freaking cool anyway I just want to give
[00:22:56] you the opportunity I always always
[00:22:58] always want to tell you what I'm doing
[00:23:00] with my money and that bfts if you want
[00:23:01] to know the whole details there is a

[00:23:20] to see that there is a new episode that

[00:23:50] months so it's actually this is my love
[00:23:52] project so anyway check it out there's a
[00:23:54] link in the description and also I
[00:23:56] bought the NFC of course I bought no n
[00:23:58] monks so so Nord monkey so if you if you
[00:24:00] want to check that out it's actually
[00:24:02] quite cool now why do I do that and
[00:24:05] again I'm going to have a whole series
[00:24:07] on this I'm going to do shows and videos
[00:24:10] and I'm going to talk a lot about you on
[00:24:11] my ex but Ro Paul had a fantastic tweet
[00:24:15] that I read today morning and I
[00:24:17] retweeted it but the tldr is the highest
[00:24:21] conviction bets set it and forget it
[00:24:24] meaning nfts are not for flipping that's
[00:24:26] what I really realized it's not for like
[00:24:27] I'm buying nft and then I'm going to
[00:24:28] sell it for expenses that's not why
[00:24:29] you're buying it you're buying it
[00:24:30] holding it okay set it and forgeted
[00:24:33] investment for the next 10 years is
[00:24:34] crypto
[00:24:36] art now for me it's most compelling
[00:24:38] enjoyable and interesting area in crypto
[00:24:40] you can talk about all that but what he
[00:24:42] really says if a s say BTC is Manhattan
[00:24:46] real estate in the early days then the
[00:24:49] best crypto order nfts are the scarcest
[00:24:52] most desirable block spaces of all it is
[00:24:55] blindingly effing obvious so if you can
[00:25:00] imagine and here's how you should look
[00:25:01] at it now before I became an nft maxi
[00:25:04] right I looked at this thing and I was
[00:25:06] like why the [ __ ] are you buying a jpack
[00:25:08] doesn't make any sense I can just
[00:25:09] screenshot it that's not the whole point
[00:25:12] the whole point is that you're buying
[00:25:15] into the future and I know it sounds
[00:25:17] crazy but trust me when you buy an you
[00:25:21] have to buy the right projects but Ian
[00:25:24] from from Ledger he he is the chief
[00:25:26] experience officer at Legend is very
[00:25:28] very cool guy been working with Louis
[00:25:29] Vuitton and and and and apple and he's
[00:25:31] been opening my eye about this he was
[00:25:33] like will people talk about Crypt punks
[00:25:36] in 50 years like you go to the museum
[00:25:40] and you visit steam engines but you
[00:25:43] drive an electric car why because it's
[00:25:44] interesting because it was the first one
[00:25:46] it was part of History this is where we
[00:25:48] came from when everything will be nfts
[00:25:51] you're going to talk about nfts that was
[00:25:53] the first thing so you have to buy Blue
[00:25:55] Chip nfts not only great community and
[00:25:57] whatever that's great but you have to
[00:25:58] buy blue chip nfts that will be part of
[00:26:01] History I'm not going to talk more about
[00:26:03] this but read this I retweeted it it's
[00:26:05] on my ex read this read this I 100%
[00:26:08] agree with Roa such a such a such a such
[00:26:11] a great post and then you'll obviously
[00:26:13] be able to see it on on I have I give
[00:26:15] all my reasoning why I bought what I
[00:26:16] bought for $113,000 in the Vlog episode
[00:26:19] now another news which came out on
[00:26:20] December 5th Phantom will integrate sui
[00:26:23] Phantom is the salon trading wallet
[00:26:25] right we know it meme coin wallet but
[00:26:28] but it will be it will be integrating
[00:26:32] sui why this is a big deal and why am I
[00:26:34] talking about now is because it's
[00:26:35] happening soon and you have to position
[00:26:37] yourself and one of the best things you
[00:26:38] can do is you can start buying SOI memes
[00:26:42] now you can look at the be memes you can
[00:26:43] buy the big memes whatever that is I
[00:26:45] wanted to bring you one meme to your
[00:26:46] attention tardy I am invested okay I
[00:26:50] have bought the token but also I see
[00:26:53] major major people like kleess pushing
[00:26:55] it um and many more than Kess but Kess
[00:26:59] is one of the guys who I who I rely on
[00:27:01] when it comes to these things uh and
[00:27:03] yeah anyway so I just wanted to tell you
[00:27:05] it's at 20 mil when I first talked about
[00:27:07] it was like 5 mil or something on the
[00:27:09] show here so I'm just calling this and I
[00:27:12] do believe that Phantom when Phantom
[00:27:13] starts again this is not Financial
[00:27:15] advice you do whatever you want to do
[00:27:16] I'm not paid to do this I'm just going
[00:27:18] to tell you what I think and what I'm
[00:27:20] doing with my own money and I am buying
[00:27:22] tardy why because when the Su
[00:27:24] integration comes in Phantom most of
[00:27:26] these memes can easily pull a 5X I do
[00:27:28] not see any reason with the website with
[00:27:30] everything that [ __ ] is doing and
[00:27:31] especially how early you are you would
[00:27:33] be at 23 million do not see this not
[00:27:35] going 200 million that's a Forex and
[00:27:37] we're going to look back at it and maybe
[00:27:39] I get rugged and then we're all going to
[00:27:40] laugh talking about memes holy [ __ ] I've
[00:27:43] been playing around with decelerate guys
[00:27:46] hear me out here they are the partners
[00:27:48] of the channel ran calls us up he's like
[00:27:50] hey we have a partner decelerate check
[00:27:52] it out I was like okay I'm not really
[00:27:54] interested and whatever and I opened it
[00:27:56] throughout the holidays I am I put in I
[00:27:59] think 1.5 soul and I'm up about one soul
[00:28:02] in the past 3 Days full automated BR let
[00:28:06] me show you how it works so here is how
[00:28:08] it works decelerate basically what you
[00:28:10] you can do a bunch of things I'm going
[00:28:11] to do a full tutorial on this as well
[00:28:13] because it's insane but in general what
[00:28:15] I would what I would want you to look at
[00:28:18] is their automation on telegram calls
[00:28:20] okay you can look up bunch of telegram
[00:28:22] calling channels right you come here you
[00:28:24] sign up there's a link in the
[00:28:25] description you sign up uh and you you
[00:28:28] you you you get you land on here you
[00:28:29] will have this you go into terminal you
[00:28:32] will have nothing here okay you will you
[00:28:33] won't have all this here you will have
[00:28:35] telegram you will have to connect your
[00:28:36] telegram account very important when you
[00:28:37] connect your telegram account it will
[00:28:39] tell you that you need a password as
[00:28:40] well there is a setting on telegram
[00:28:42] which I didn't know that you can set if
[00:28:44] you want to connect your telegram with
[00:28:45] another service you can set this
[00:28:46] password it's under security so check
[00:28:48] that out if you want but so you so you
[00:28:50] go on here you connected you join into
[00:28:53] these caller telegram groups okay caller
[00:28:56] telegram groups that means you're going
[00:28:58] to join into these random groups that
[00:29:02] post contract addresses you can't
[00:29:04] monitor those so what you do you come in
[00:29:06] here and once you put in so for example
[00:29:07] here is one I just found this Kurama
[00:29:10] gambles okay I don't even know what the
[00:29:11] [ __ ] this is I just found it okay so I
[00:29:13] don't know let's go kurab it's randomly
[00:29:16] online founded so I go in here and once
[00:29:19] you connect your uh your account what
[00:29:23] you will be able to do is it will show
[00:29:25] you exactly how much much gains these
[00:29:29] calls made this call here has been uh
[00:29:32] has been called on the 27th of December
[00:29:36] and it made a 4X since then so in two
[00:29:38] days this here was called 23rd of
[00:29:41] December made 1.3 so 33% this one here
[00:29:45] made 6% this one here made 56% so on so
[00:29:48] on so on now there you can find call
[00:29:51] groups add all the groups to your
[00:29:53] telegram as you can you can click on you
[00:29:55] can come here you can click on plus you
[00:29:57] can search for your telegram groups once
[00:29:59] you find your telegram group you can
[00:30:01] just edit here and you can see the
[00:30:02] statistics if the statistics is good
[00:30:04] here's what you do you you go up here
[00:30:06] you click on the name of the group and
[00:30:08] you set this bot here on what you want
[00:30:10] to buy you set like 0.1 Solana whatever
[00:30:14] that is and you can set a Target where
[00:30:16] you want to get out automatically so
[00:30:19] even if you're just gambling on the fact
[00:30:21] that there are a bunch of people in a
[00:30:22] group and they're going to buy into the
[00:30:23] token that is being posted if you can be
[00:30:25] the first one you can make massive
[00:30:27] massive gains so what I do just put it
[00:30:29] put it in here how much you want to buy
[00:30:31] on on a call and put in at 1% of gain
[00:30:34] you want to sell 1% of your portfolio so
[00:30:36] for example I say every four if the
[00:30:39] token pumps 40% off my Buy sell 75% of
[00:30:42] my portfolio simple I go save one thing
[00:30:45] you want to do priority set it to High
[00:30:47] make sure you set it to high and that's
[00:30:50] it I took all these trades I am up I'm
[00:30:54] up so I I deposited I deposited uh one
[00:30:57] and a half Solana so now it went down it
[00:30:59] was 2.9 the morning so obviously it's a
[00:31:02] zero sum games so you obviously going to
[00:31:04] what you got to do is you just got to
[00:31:05] play this and as you play more it's a VC
[00:31:07] model you're going to buy into like a
[00:31:09] bunch of [ __ ] and then on the numbers
[00:31:12] game you have to make sure that you pick
[00:31:14] the groups based on the statistics that
[00:31:16] make the most sense and then at the end
[00:31:18] of the day you're going to come out PR
[00:31:19] profit but I'm up half of Solana in like
[00:31:21] three days which is not bad either it's
[00:31:23] like $70 and I did nothing other than
[00:31:26] the fact that simply set this up anyway
[00:31:29] so I'm up this I I hold these to tokens
[00:31:31] I don't even know what they are but I
[00:31:33] hold is
[00:31:37] this bra okay anyway so you get the
[00:31:40] point there's a link in the description
[00:31:42] play around it's completely free it's
[00:31:44] insane and you can do limit targets I'm
[00:31:46] going to I'm going to really do a
[00:31:47] complete tutorial on this but in general
[00:31:49] it's pretty cool you have to check them
[00:31:51] out it's it's it's incredible it's
[00:31:53] incredible incredible okay let's go on
[00:31:57] to eth if you have a sizable BTC bag
[00:32:00] that you don't mind being flexible would
[00:32:02] you probably better rotating into eth
[00:32:04] here is what I'm thinking about this eth
[00:32:06] rotation I got a lot of questions I have
[00:32:08] a very very simple answer and yes I do
[00:32:10] think eth is going to catch a bid yes I
[00:32:12] am going to play this yes I am going to
[00:32:15] buy eth I'm going to Long eth whatever
[00:32:17] here's what I want to see if you look at
[00:32:18] the vehicle chart beautiful retrade this
[00:32:20] is eth BTC beautiful retrace into a vly
[00:32:24] aut block beautiful this is what we want
[00:32:25] to see fantastic incredible what you see
[00:32:28] here 2017 what did you see came back
[00:32:31] December 2017 what happened 40% pump all
[00:32:35] the way came back to what to the vly
[00:32:36] will be
[00:32:37] here you see perfectly 2020 2017 300%
[00:32:42] gain this is exactly what I'm expecting
[00:32:43] here so I'm expecting the eth eth BTC
[00:32:47] chart to pull something like this okay
[00:32:50] I'm expecting it to pull something like
[00:32:51] this would would put us around 150 180
[00:32:54] 200% on E BTC that means you'll
[00:32:57] outperform Form B Bitcoin with ethereum
[00:32:59] about two times okay so what do I need
[00:33:03] to see for this it's super simple I need
[00:33:05] to see one simple thing and that's a
[00:33:07] daily close
[00:33:09] above the major high and that's it so I
[00:33:12] need to see a daily close above why I
[00:33:14] don't have my thing
[00:33:16] here it doesn't come up no problems
[00:33:19] we'll just do it like this so I need to
[00:33:22] see this is this is what we call a
[00:33:23] market structure shift we're going to
[00:33:26] see we're going to see a market
[00:33:27] structure shift like this if we close
[00:33:29] Above This level which is currently at
[00:33:33] 0.041 I am going to take a heavy heavy
[00:33:36] heavy heavy heavy eth position heavy so
[00:33:38] I'm going to take a heavy e position and
[00:33:40] I'm going to ride it all the way back up
[00:33:42] my target for this as I said my target
[00:33:44] for E BTC is about 0.0
[00:33:48] 0.085 to 0.1 is that's the ratio that I
[00:33:52] want to look at so approximately up here
[00:33:54] about $88,000 E I think it's
[00:33:56] reasonable ,000 $9,000 eth U is what
[00:34:00] I'll be looking at so this is the eth E
[00:34:03] eth scenario another news El now holds
[00:34:06] $6,000 or 6,000 bitcoins worth about 570
[00:34:11] million this is just showing the the
[00:34:13] strength of holding your coins like
[00:34:15] literally just buying and holding um and
[00:34:17] buying and holding talking about buying
[00:34:19] and holding uh use a cold wallet if you
[00:34:22] want to use a cold wallet use a cold
[00:34:24] wallet there's a link in the description
[00:34:25] for Ledger um and and this is the
[00:34:28] craziest story okay this is crazy crazy
[00:34:31] crazy crazy crazy so Chinese
[00:34:35] geologists discovered one tons of
[00:34:39] gold 1,000 tons of gold that's an extra
[00:34:45] 0.5% added to the global Supply let me
[00:34:49] give you an example here that means if
[00:34:51] they would just say oh we actually just
[00:34:54] discovered 1 million Bitcoins
[00:34:57] that's that's kind of what it means okay
[00:34:59] they be no hold on a second 20 21
[00:35:02] million that will be 5% so it'll be
[00:35:04] about 100 that would be hold on a second
[00:35:06] how much that is 100,000 Bitcoins yes so
[00:35:09] they discovered 100,000 Bitcoins they be
[00:35:11] like hey we discovered 100,000 Bitcoins
[00:35:14] just laying around somewhere that's the
[00:35:15] same scenario now this does not sound
[00:35:17] much but it's insane that's a lot why
[00:35:20] few things why Bitcoin is better than
[00:35:22] gold again for Peter schi this is this
[00:35:24] is for you one is there is no way to
[00:35:28] just discover 100,000 Bitcoin they
[00:35:31] mathematically not possible okay the way
[00:35:34] the whole thing is created and coded and
[00:35:36] and and design and run is that it is not
[00:35:39] possible to increase Supply it's just
[00:35:40] not possible as opposed to Gold where
[00:35:43] we've been like oh there's a meteorite
[00:35:45] which is containing billions of dollars
[00:35:47] worth of gold and now nazza is trying to
[00:35:49] figure out how they can bring you know
[00:35:50] that that's so [ __ ] garbage the whole
[00:35:53] thing is garbage why because if you have
[00:35:56] for example scientists discovering the
[00:35:58] 2,000 M below ground in China they can
[00:36:00] get 1,000 ton of gold you don't know how
[00:36:03] much gold exists in the world you do not
[00:36:05] know and you're betting on something as
[00:36:07] a store of value because of the limited
[00:36:09] Supply which is not limited in Supply so
[00:36:12] anyway this this is a serious serious
[00:36:15] thing and I do believe that for anybody
[00:36:17] who understands and trust me the big
[00:36:19] guys will understand the fact that hey
[00:36:20] there is half% of the there there is
[00:36:23] 0.2% added to there is 0.2% % of the
[00:36:29] global supplies added to the supply of
[00:36:31] gold you know what I mean that's that's
[00:36:33] massive massive massive news that we
[00:36:35] don't really talk about so anyway this
[00:36:37] is just another reason why it's better
[00:36:38] to to buy uh Bitcoin than gold guys I
[00:36:42] hope you enjoy this I'm sorry I couldn't
[00:36:43] be here live uh but I had a lot of stuff
[00:36:45] that is going on currently I'm somewhere
[00:36:47] going around when you're watching this
[00:36:49] uh but I recorded it about 2 hours
[00:36:51] before now you're watching this you know
[00:36:52] I'm I'm talking to the Future anyway so
[00:36:54] truly truly appreciate you watching one
[00:36:56] more thing I wanted to say one one more
[00:36:57] thing we're running a massive massive
[00:36:59] campaign with nordvpn I almost forgot to
[00:37:01] say
[00:37:02] that it's uh it's uh VPN you need a VPN
[00:37:06] no question I'm not even going to talk
[00:37:07] about it I got someone dming me
[00:37:09] yesterday and they said they got $95,000
[00:37:12] stolen from them and the the main reason
[00:37:14] is because they clicked on a freaking
[00:37:15] fishing link nordvpn protects you from
[00:37:17] that it's very simple it's like $5 a
[00:37:19] month $3 a month I don't even know how
[00:37:20] much it is but it's it's nothing
[00:37:22] compared to the losses that you can
[00:37:24] incur very simple you get a VPN like nor
[00:37:26] VPN they they have a threat protection
[00:37:28] built in that means that when you click
[00:37:31] on a link it will tell you do not click
[00:37:32] on this link because it's a fishing link
[00:37:34] they all steal oil your crypto it's very
[00:37:36] very simple very cheap you need a VPN if
[00:37:40] you want to use nor VPN there is a link
[00:37:42] in the description I would appreciate if
[00:37:43] you use it but if even if you don't use
[00:37:45] my link please promise me you're going
[00:37:46] to use a VPN I dedicated my life to
[00:37:48] helping you guys and this is what I'm
[00:37:50] doing if you do not use a VPN and you're
[00:37:53] in crypto you're making an extremely big
[00:37:55] mistake and sooner or later you will
[00:37:56] realize it it's just very simple use a
[00:37:58] wepn it's very simple guys truly
