# Raw Transcript

[00:00:10] what's going on everyone my name is
[00:00:11] Nicholas meron here from day to Dash and
[00:00:13] today is December 30th of 2024 well
[00:00:16] folks I hope you all are having a
[00:00:17] fantastic day wherever you are because
[00:00:19] in today's video we have got an
[00:00:20] imperative update to discuss when it
[00:00:22] comes to Bitcoin altcoins in the broader
[00:00:24] Market we are expecting a major collapse
[00:00:27] over the next two weeks as Bitcoin is
[00:00:29] starting to showcase not only really
[00:00:31] worrying signs with his price action but
[00:00:33] we are obviously seeing altcoins follow
[00:00:34] as well and even macro recessionary
[00:00:37] indicators starting to flare up in a
[00:00:40] significant way so I want to spend some
[00:00:41] time to break down all of this I want to
[00:00:43] talk about the fundamentals the inflows
[00:00:45] and outflows the price analysis grab a
[00:00:47] cup of coffee stick with me here guys if
[00:00:49] you enjoyed the video consider dropping
[00:00:50] a like and let's go ahead and kick
[00:00:52] things off so I want to start here by
[00:00:54] talking a little bit about what's going
[00:00:55] on within bitcoin's price because this
[00:00:57] really out of all things is probably the
[00:00:59] biggest conc concerning element for me
[00:01:01] because of the weight Bitcoin holds and
[00:01:03] the performance of all altcoins and
[00:01:05] crypto a whole essentially since our
[00:01:07] recent alltime high back here in
[00:01:09] December 17th at around
[00:01:11] $108,000 we've pulled back down to
[00:01:13] around
[00:01:14] 93,500 bucks now while this isn't
[00:01:17] obviously the end of the world here from
[00:01:19] a correction perspective we've seen much
[00:01:21] worse the thing we need to prepare
[00:01:22] ourselves for is what's coming next and
[00:01:25] price action is starting to Showcase
[00:01:26] some really worrying signs there are two
[00:01:28] primary things I want to talk about here
[00:01:30] the moving averages and I also want to
[00:01:32] talk about the line of Prior resistance
[00:01:35] that hopefully can turn into new support
[00:01:37] that's what the Bulls should be hoping
[00:01:38] for here we need buyers to show up at
[00:01:40] this level if we are to sustain a longer
[00:01:43] term uptrend before facing some
[00:01:45] significant correction so first off
[00:01:48] let's talk about the moving averages and
[00:01:49] we'll come to that line the moving
[00:01:51] averages the 21-day moving averages
[00:01:53] which were a perfect by the dip
[00:01:54] opportunity and every small pullback
[00:01:56] since back here in October since we
[00:01:59] really kicked off off this trend from
[00:02:00] around $60,000 all the way up here
[00:02:03] towards
[00:02:04] $108,000 Bitcoin huge price appreciation
[00:02:07] in a short window time again very
[00:02:09] similar to what we saw back here during
[00:02:11] this window time between February post
[00:02:13] the ETF launch from 42k all the way up
[00:02:16] here to
[00:02:17] $73,000 exact same kind of trend here
[00:02:20] and what we're seeing just like last
[00:02:22] time is a break of that 21 day a clear
[00:02:25] Breakaway of trend structure and in fact
[00:02:26] this time around we're actually seeing a
[00:02:28] lot more weakness on the trend than what
[00:02:30] we saw back in December excuse me around
[00:02:34] January to March of 2024 right so this
[00:02:37] is a really important thing to keep in
[00:02:39] mind here that the 21-day which used to
[00:02:41] be acting as support ever since back in
[00:02:43] late October is now acting as resistance
[00:02:46] very clearly here not to mention the big
[00:02:47] even level of $100,000 acting as
[00:02:50] resistance as a sell point that is not
[00:02:52] good we should be seeing this big even
[00:02:54] levels being support when we clear
[00:02:55] through them if we want to maintain the
[00:02:57] bullish Trend and it's very clear here
[00:02:59] if we just just take a look at our
[00:03:00] moving averages that if we essentially
[00:03:02] are treating the 21 days resistance
[00:03:04] we're looking for our next major moving
[00:03:06] average pairing as potential support and
[00:03:09] the earliest you know that we're going
[00:03:10] to probably reach there is probably the
[00:03:12] 100 day which is down here at around
[00:03:15] $85,000 and that's the EMA here which is
[00:03:17] moving faster could very well be
[00:03:18] somewhere in this pocket so somewhere in
[00:03:20] the low $80,000 range if that doesn't
[00:03:23] hold then we're likely moving to the 200
[00:03:25] day which is down at around 76,000 now
[00:03:27] this will probably move up over time I'm
[00:03:29] not trying to be too melodramatic I I'm
[00:03:31] not saying that this is the end of the
[00:03:32] world here but I am saying that this is
[00:03:34] a pretty significant correction where we
[00:03:37] could be seeing from a top to bottom
[00:03:39] analysis probably a 25 to 30% pullback
[00:03:42] right somewhere in this ballpark here
[00:03:45] right so that's not something that would
[00:03:47] be the end of the world but it's going
[00:03:48] to be a pretty bad situation for
[00:03:50] altcoins right the last thing I want to
[00:03:51] talk about price here and then I want to
[00:03:53] explain why this is happening is the
[00:03:55] prior line of historic resistance made
[00:03:57] up of the two prior highs in the last
[00:03:59] cycle if this level is not held as
[00:04:02] support that very much makes the case
[00:04:04] that we're likely coming into these
[00:04:06] moving averages here that this is very
[00:04:07] well likely a short-term deviation
[00:04:10] trapping a lot of traders who bought in
[00:04:12] here on Leverage over the last couple of
[00:04:14] months it would be the perfect trap for
[00:04:15] exchanges to liquidate people for people
[00:04:18] who have Overexposed themselves IE
[00:04:20] companies like micro strategy to be put
[00:04:22] in a tighter position and essentially be
[00:04:25] essentially in a state of higher rates
[00:04:27] of capitulation that could allow for a
[00:04:29] lot lot of those traders to have to be
[00:04:30] forced out of positions either through
[00:04:32] their stop losses or through getting
[00:04:34] liquidated by being overleveraged in the
[00:04:35] market to essentially allow for a major
[00:04:37] flush out here and for a lot of people
[00:04:39] to see a big loss of capital that is a
[00:04:42] really big concern of mine right here
[00:04:44] when it comes to the price analysis but
[00:04:45] I want to talk about why we're also
[00:04:47] seeing this weakening in price there's a
[00:04:49] couple important Dynamics to talk about
[00:04:51] at the end of the day people talk about
[00:04:53] manipulation people talk about
[00:04:54] manipulation to the upside they talk
[00:04:55] about the downside but the big thing
[00:04:57] above all guys is that markets are of
[00:04:59] inflows and outflows you've probably
[00:05:01] heard me Echo that point over the last
[00:05:03] couple years if you stuck with me here
[00:05:04] in the day to dash Channel and really
[00:05:06] ignored a lot of the noise out there and
[00:05:08] try to focus on the signal of What
[00:05:09] markets telling you price action lets
[00:05:11] you know at the end of the day whether
[00:05:13] there are more Market buyers or more
[00:05:15] Market Sellers and that is really the
[00:05:16] ultimate question at the end of the day
[00:05:18] are there more people who are willing to
[00:05:19] clear through the asks on the order book
[00:05:22] are there more buyers willing to pay a
[00:05:24] premium from the existing market price
[00:05:25] of Bitcoin or there more people willing
[00:05:27] to sell versus potential buyers or bids
[00:05:31] on the order book that is what leads to
[00:05:33] Trend direction of price if we take a
[00:05:35] look here at what we saw back in
[00:05:37] December I would still say above all
[00:05:39] that you know the numbers are not
[00:05:40] terrible by any means we still saw
[00:05:42] around 100 more than
[00:05:45] 100,000 coming to close to about 106,000
[00:05:48] Bitcoin uh if you also include Marathon
[00:05:51] as well essentially speaking probably
[00:05:54] 110,000 Bitcoin being swallowed up by
[00:05:57] institutional players through either the
[00:05:58] ETF through miners that are also doing
[00:06:01] accumulation strategies like Marathon or
[00:06:03] micro strategy which is still buying up
[00:06:06] a pretty substantial amount of Bitcoin
[00:06:08] this is still the second largest month
[00:06:09] we have on record here for micro
[00:06:11] strategy purchases throughout the past
[00:06:14] year so it's not the end of the world
[00:06:17] right things are still looking pretty
[00:06:18] good here in the demand side but if you
[00:06:21] consider that
[00:06:23] essentially we've seen the price action
[00:06:25] we've seen over the past month here from
[00:06:28] December 17th the last two weeks really
[00:06:30] but even just going back here to the
[00:06:31] beginning of the month right essentially
[00:06:33] Bitcoin is still down for the month by
[00:06:36] about $3,000 let's just even say let's
[00:06:38] be fair here let's say it's neutral
[00:06:40] right we have a neutral month and micro
[00:06:44] strategy and the ETFs and Marathon a
[00:06:47] whole range of other corporate Treasures
[00:06:49] have bought well over 100,000 Bitcoin in
[00:06:52] a
[00:06:53] month what does that tell you about the
[00:06:56] buy and sell side equation here it tells
[00:06:58] me that there's a lot of cide pressure
[00:07:01] here at $100,000 at six
[00:07:06] figures and the fact is that a lot of
[00:07:10] this buy side demand the majority over
[00:07:12] the last two months has come from one
[00:07:15] single entity that is micro strategy
[00:07:17] it's not coming from institutions buying
[00:07:19] the ETFs particularly that has been
[00:07:21] declining since back in October right
[00:07:23] still a great number right still a lot
[00:07:25] of demand not here to Badger on not
[00:07:28] trying to be negative I'm just just
[00:07:29] trying to point out the reality here
[00:07:30] which is that price action is clearly
[00:07:32] showing that we need a lot more buy side
[00:07:34] liquidity here and that's a big Point
[00:07:35] I've always brought up here in this
[00:07:36] channel guys which is that at the end of
[00:07:39] the day as markets grow larger and
[00:07:40] larger the demand for inflows grows
[00:07:44] larger and larger as well and if we
[00:07:46] really consider this right while these
[00:07:48] ETF flows are not bad and obviously
[00:07:50] micro strategy coming in and buying some
[00:07:51] as well obviously this is great the
[00:07:54] problem is is that it's nowhere near
[00:07:56] enough to face the already existing 20
[00:07:58] million coin out there in circulation
[00:08:01] that could very well be sold at any
[00:08:02] minute for people who essentially want
[00:08:04] to get the best available market price
[00:08:06] right not saying everyone is dumping I'm
[00:08:08] just saying here price action isn't
[00:08:10] lying it's letting us know here that
[00:08:12] there's been some short-term exhaustion
[00:08:14] and the things that were previously
[00:08:16] acting as support are now acting as
[00:08:17] resistance this is something that is
[00:08:19] imperative to understand and another
[00:08:21] Dynamic that plays into this especially
[00:08:23] as we're talking about micro strategy
[00:08:24] becoming this big kind of Silo uh you
[00:08:27] know set of demand for Bitcoin right
[00:08:29] this is really what markets are betting
[00:08:31] on here is that micro strategy is going
[00:08:33] to keep buying more Bitcoin we need to
[00:08:35] understand how they can afford to keep
[00:08:36] buying Bitcoin and that is the micro
[00:08:37] strategy premium which so far has
[00:08:40] declined significantly since back in mid
[00:08:42] November for about a month and a half
[00:08:44] here we' have seen the premium decline
[00:08:47] by a
[00:08:48] whopping 40% here during this window of
[00:08:51] time 40% so what I want to emphasize by
[00:08:55] this is that if there is any convertible
[00:08:57] node offerings that is if micro strategy
[00:08:59] can get people who are interested still
[00:09:00] in this offering this kind of game of
[00:09:02] musical chairs that you know micro
[00:09:04] strategist price is going to keep going
[00:09:05] up Bitcoin is going to keep going up uh
[00:09:07] therefore take these convertible notes
[00:09:08] that are going to pay you no interest
[00:09:10] and the only way you're really going to
[00:09:11] be making money is if the share price
[00:09:13] Market strategy goes up a certain amount
[00:09:14] then you can essentially um activate at
[00:09:17] the strike price from those convertible
[00:09:19] notes and then be able to make a nice
[00:09:21] profit right we talked about that in a
[00:09:22] prior video if you guys wanted to learn
[00:09:24] about that um I definitely recommend you
[00:09:26] check it out I I did a video on on kind
[00:09:28] of basically how uh bitcoin's price uh
[00:09:31] is essentially forming over time and
[00:09:34] it's due to what's really driving the
[00:09:35] price and it's m mainly this kind of
[00:09:37] game of musical chairs from micr Strat
[00:09:39] it's not Ponzi or anything like that but
[00:09:41] there are going to be people who are
[00:09:42] left empty-handed or at a minimum people
[00:09:44] are going to stop taking the offer right
[00:09:46] and that is going to diminish the micro
[00:09:48] strategy premium here it is going to
[00:09:50] diminish the amount of Bitcoin that
[00:09:52] micro strategy can purchase uh from
[00:09:55] issuing new shares and diluting his base
[00:09:57] and that is going to effectively reduce
[00:09:59] the demand for Bitcoin and I want to
[00:10:01] talk about how important this is right
[00:10:02] now guys because while I know everyone
[00:10:04] out there likes to buy into narratives
[00:10:06] if you take a good look around all of
[00:10:08] the companies and corporations you know
[00:10:11] the people are saying oh you know
[00:10:12] there's there's talks that Microsoft or
[00:10:14] Amazon are going to go out there and buy
[00:10:16] Bitcoin well if you take a look none of
[00:10:18] them did it none of them went out and
[00:10:20] bought it micro strategy is in a league
[00:10:22] of its own it is a kind of pseudo
[00:10:24] speculative Bitcoin ETF it has been that
[00:10:26] for the last few years and we can see
[00:10:30] right now that its share price is
[00:10:31] Trading still even from its prior Highs
[00:10:34] at 420 per premium from where it started
[00:10:37] when it started its Bitcoin treasury
[00:10:39] strategy in August of 2020 it is still
[00:10:42] up 225% well above the 2021 uh highs
[00:10:45] here both from here in February and June
[00:10:48] of 2021 so I'm not saying that this has
[00:10:51] to collapse I'm just letting you all
[00:10:52] know here that if micro strategy is
[00:10:54] already exhausting itself at this point
[00:10:56] to buy as much Bitcoin as possible and
[00:10:58] it's not able to hold it up that could
[00:11:00] be a big sign of concern here how much
[00:11:02] do we really need to sustain these
[00:11:05] prices here right it is very important
[00:11:08] to keep that in mind guys we have to ask
[00:11:10] the question about what are the existing
[00:11:12] holders doing now is sentiment still
[00:11:14] there are the hoders still holding out
[00:11:17] now this leads me to talking obviously
[00:11:18] about what's going on in the broader
[00:11:19] altcoin Market as well I want to go
[00:11:22] ahead and what's talk and talk a little
[00:11:23] bit about altcoins and some of our our
[00:11:26] trends that we're watching some
[00:11:27] different plays but we have already
[00:11:28] corrected from those relative Highs at R
[00:11:31] valuation of
[00:11:32] $3.75 trillion do down to 3.2 so we've
[00:11:36] already wiped out whopping 500 billion
[00:11:40] plus in market capitalization and it
[00:11:42] looks like we could still very well be
[00:11:44] in to continue correcting I think that
[00:11:46] at a minimum you are going to see a
[00:11:48] retest of that 100 day it's not crazy to
[00:11:50] say that we saw it in two days from the
[00:11:52] 21-day moving average back here in uh
[00:11:55] excuse me in um April of 2024 we went
[00:11:57] from around 2.5 trillion at 2.1 trillion
[00:12:00] right in a matter of Just 2 days right
[00:12:02] and that would essentially lead us down
[00:12:03] to a market cap around $2.8 trillion or
[00:12:06] essentially put us back to where we were
[00:12:07] here in early November again not here to
[00:12:10] say it's the end of the world just yet
[00:12:11] but at least in the short term that's a
[00:12:13] cause for concern uh we will again be
[00:12:15] obviously emphasizing as well the
[00:12:17] long-term concerns right if what if we
[00:12:19] can't find support on the 100 a what if
[00:12:21] we can't find support on the 200 day
[00:12:23] moving average I would think that that
[00:12:25] spells very bad news for crypto markets
[00:12:27] and again we'll talk about that more in
[00:12:28] the m macro section but we can see here
[00:12:30] as well you know we're really focused on
[00:12:32] altcoins we want to find those plays
[00:12:34] where we can put you know even
[00:12:35] fractional amounts of capital or you
[00:12:36] know decent position of our our free and
[00:12:39] open Capital to trade into plays that
[00:12:42] could give us a two three five 10 a
[00:12:45] return right in mcoin space and all
[00:12:48] these different emerging narratives in
[00:12:49] crypto well right now since back here in
[00:12:52] December 7th allcoin dominance has
[00:12:54] dropped significantly we're down about
[00:12:56] two percentage points from those prior
[00:12:58] highs back in December and along with
[00:13:00] that we are now trading the 21-day as
[00:13:02] well as the 200 we EMA and the 200 we
[00:13:05] SMA as
[00:13:07] resistance not very good looking guys
[00:13:11] having the um the simple moving average
[00:13:13] 200 week acting as resistance first not
[00:13:16] a good not a good thing breaking support
[00:13:19] on the 21-day in the 200 we EMA not a
[00:13:21] good look and now those are acting as
[00:13:24] resistance chances are you're going to
[00:13:26] probably get a low retest here in the 9%
[00:13:29] range at a minimum and with a Bitcoin
[00:13:31] correction uh going down another you
[00:13:33] know 10 15 20% from here and altcoins
[00:13:36] following and fairing worse off this
[00:13:39] means that we're going to see much lower
[00:13:42] prices here for altcoins or at a minimum
[00:13:44] see some levels that we saw back here on
[00:13:46] December 20th when dominance was at that
[00:13:48] lower range so definitely keep that in
[00:13:52] mind here and I want you to also keep in
[00:13:54] mind another Dynamic here which is
[00:13:55] dollar dominance now as this starts to
[00:13:58] get to really extreme levels like upper
[00:14:00] single digit territory double digit
[00:14:01] territory that actually might spell good
[00:14:03] news because that might mean that we're
[00:14:04] getting towards the end of capitulation
[00:14:05] there might be some great buy thep
[00:14:07] opportunities but essentially what this
[00:14:08] is measuring here is the market share of
[00:14:11] usdt or tether and usdc or usdc coin
[00:14:14] these are uh usdcoin which are the two
[00:14:16] major stable coins in the crypto space
[00:14:19] and as this starts to move up here this
[00:14:20] is starting to signal that the risk on
[00:14:22] sentiment is starting to Decay that the
[00:14:24] premium P people are willing to pay for
[00:14:26] altcoins is going down or stable coin
[00:14:30] dominance and stable coin liquidity here
[00:14:33] is not increasing fast enough to be able
[00:14:35] to continue sustaining uh that continued
[00:14:38] upside movement in the market and that
[00:14:41] essentially means that valuations are
[00:14:42] likely Contracting we saw basically a
[00:14:44] double top here in usdt and usdc
[00:14:47] dominance at 5% similar to where we were
[00:14:50] back here in March and as you all saw
[00:14:52] when we broke that 21 day right this is
[00:14:54] again where all the fun was from
[00:14:56] February of 2024 here to March uh or for
[00:14:59] example when we broke the 21 day here on
[00:15:02] October 2023 going into January 2024
[00:15:05] those are the periods of time where you
[00:15:06] want to be in the market when this thing
[00:15:08] starts to move up I know it sounds kind
[00:15:10] of counterintuitive here it's usually a
[00:15:12] bad sign it's a sign here that valuation
[00:15:14] premiums are going down right people are
[00:15:17] flocking back to cash right and
[00:15:19] essentially that we've got a ways to go
[00:15:22] before the trend is going to start going
[00:15:23] back to the upside especially if we
[00:15:26] can't hold on that 100 day moving
[00:15:27] average over the next couple CP of weeks
[00:15:29] that is a very critical thing to keep an
[00:15:31] eye on so make sure you watch this usdt
[00:15:35] .d plus USD C.D this is a combination
[00:15:38] it's a custom index that you can do
[00:15:40] within trading view uh but the main
[00:15:42] thing I want to just show here guys as
[00:15:43] we just take a look across the board on
[00:15:44] the market all the things we talked
[00:15:46] about avoiding right staying away from
[00:15:49] not getting caught in the Trap right xrp
[00:15:53] here continuing to bleed out against
[00:15:55] Bitcoin right down about 800 SATs here
[00:15:58] from the recent prior highs right close
[00:16:00] to a 33% correction here already from
[00:16:03] that prior high range right so this
[00:16:06] looks like it's going to continue going
[00:16:07] down here the 200 week is all the way
[00:16:09] down here that's a 40% correction the
[00:16:11] 100 day 200 day looking at a 50 to 60%
[00:16:14] plus correction from here the fact that
[00:16:16] we were unable to hold in this 20 And1
[00:16:18] day we hit the 100 EMA 100 month EMA
[00:16:22] this looks way overbought stay away from
[00:16:25] this right xlm as well same exact
[00:16:28] situation it's already fared off a lot
[00:16:29] worse though 21-day has consistently
[00:16:31] been resistance easily avoidable right
[00:16:34] and it looks like we're easily coming
[00:16:35] into these moving averages here you can
[00:16:37] try to find some buy the dep
[00:16:39] opportunities there but I would wait
[00:16:40] until you get deep into those moving
[00:16:42] averages again just would not be
[00:16:43] touching it here at these valuations a
[00:16:45] lot of people unfortunately getting
[00:16:46] trapped salana as well I know a lot of
[00:16:49] people are obviously bullish on salana
[00:16:51] as this kind of the ethereum of this
[00:16:53] cycle I have to tell you guys I think
[00:16:54] it's had its moment in the past we can
[00:16:56] see very clearly here against Bitcoin
[00:16:59] it's been facing resistance at the 21
[00:17:00] days since November 25th so it's been
[00:17:02] over a month now until that starts to
[00:17:05] change I wouldn't touch it I think
[00:17:06] you're going to get an opportunity here
[00:17:07] with salana comes down here to the 200
[00:17:09] week maybe you find a good entry
[00:17:11] opportunity there that would be at least
[00:17:13] a substantial enough discount from the
[00:17:15] prior all-time highs back in March
[00:17:18] whereby I would think you know there
[00:17:19] might be a good risk award setup here we
[00:17:22] could have a relatively decent stoploss
[00:17:24] and maybe look for some entry
[00:17:25] opportunities but the big thing above
[00:17:27] all that I'm seeing right is that across
[00:17:30] a lot of different altcoin pairs you are
[00:17:32] not finding much strength here so my
[00:17:34] point here is to keep in mind that a lot
[00:17:37] of altcoins out there are probably going
[00:17:38] to go down another 15 20 25% from here
[00:17:42] on out and that's going to knock out a
[00:17:44] lot of people it's going to knock people
[00:17:45] out of their stop losses it's going to
[00:17:47] leave people buying you know heavy bags
[00:17:50] basically and they're going to be
[00:17:50] wondering whether or not they should
[00:17:52] hold on to it I would wait until we get
[00:17:54] greater signs of capitulation in the
[00:17:56] market before we really start finding
[00:17:58] entry opport opportunities now the one
[00:18:00] thing I wanted to point out here that is
[00:18:01] getting me at least a little bit excited
[00:18:04] is the resilience we are seeing in some
[00:18:06] factions or parts of the altcoin market
[00:18:08] and mainly what I'm seeing is a return
[00:18:11] to the Legacy plays and mainly a lot of
[00:18:14] net Legacy narrative so obviously
[00:18:15] ethereum is starting to showcase at
[00:18:18] least some signs of optimism here uh
[00:18:21] basically about two months here
[00:18:23] basically the months of November and
[00:18:24] December where price action against
[00:18:26] Bitcoin has remained neutral right right
[00:18:29] so that's favorable for ethereum it's a
[00:18:31] big shift from the general Trend we've
[00:18:33] had which is generally going down here
[00:18:34] for the greater part of the last couple
[00:18:36] of years a overall 64% correction from
[00:18:39] top to bottom from the December 2021
[00:18:42] highs down here to November 2024 nearly
[00:18:45] three years here and if we can start to
[00:18:47] clear through that 100 day moving
[00:18:49] average which we we really haven't been
[00:18:50] able to do in a big way or we have a
[00:18:52] weekly close above there that's where I
[00:18:54] could start to get really excited about
[00:18:55] ethereum as a play here we're especially
[00:18:57] retesting the 21-day here so keep an eye
[00:18:59] on that but the other big thing that I
[00:19:00] want to put your kind of attention
[00:19:02] towards here is what's going on in defi
[00:19:05] now I understand defi is not the hot
[00:19:07] sexy narrative it is not meme coins it
[00:19:10] is not dpin and AI it is not real world
[00:19:12] assets it's not agents or whatever
[00:19:15] narrative or straws pulled out of the
[00:19:18] hat so to speak uh but this is one that
[00:19:21] has a really interesting and strong
[00:19:23] fundamental narrative behind it in use
[00:19:27] set of use cases and and strong actual
[00:19:29] Revenue generating capabilities that
[00:19:32] actually this kind of diamond in the
[00:19:34] rough narrative could make a big
[00:19:36] comeback over the next couple of months
[00:19:38] especially with the changes in the
[00:19:39] regulatory environment I don't see
[00:19:41] changes in regulations really helping
[00:19:42] meme coins I don't see it helping uh
[00:19:45] deepin in AI I do really see the change
[00:19:48] in regulatory regime in the United
[00:19:49] States potentially helping a lot of defi
[00:19:52] protocols being able to innovate again
[00:19:54] being able to push the boundaries being
[00:19:55] able to integrate with traditional
[00:19:57] Finance in a deeper way and if I take a
[00:19:59] look at a against BTC this chart is
[00:20:02] definitely exciting to me right as the
[00:20:05] 21 days is still holding here we're
[00:20:07] pressing against the 200 week this looks
[00:20:09] to me like a lot more optimistic than
[00:20:12] most altcoin pairs out there so I'm not
[00:20:13] trying to be all doom and gloom here
[00:20:15] right I I am looking for those kind of
[00:20:17] opportunities where strength is showing
[00:20:19] in the market and I'd much rather pay a
[00:20:21] premium on a play that showcasing
[00:20:23] strength during pullbacks than finding
[00:20:25] plays that are down the most in the
[00:20:27] market down 50 60 70% against Bitcoin I
[00:20:30] want to buy into strength here so to see
[00:20:32] this this is really exciting along with
[00:20:34] that as well uni as well while obviously
[00:20:36] not as optimistic uh and holding as much
[00:20:38] of its gains as a still basically where
[00:20:41] it was against Bitcoin all the way back
[00:20:44] since May of 2022 or here in June of
[00:20:47] 2023 or here in October of 2023 still
[00:20:50] much higher from where it was back here
[00:20:52] in early November and I think again that
[00:20:55] this is the market starting to repic
[00:20:57] some of these plays for benefiting in an
[00:20:59] environment where finally the token
[00:21:01] holders of unap or a could really start
[00:21:05] to benefit much greatly again at the end
[00:21:07] of the day uh it's still down below the
[00:21:09] 21-day here but we're holding on those
[00:21:11] long-term moving averages that is a big
[00:21:12] shift from what we've seen before
[00:21:14] another one as well that I think you
[00:21:16] guys should keep in radar is dydx now
[00:21:18] dydx is one of our partners here on the
[00:21:20] channel dydx is a longstanding
[00:21:23] derivatives and decentralized exchange
[00:21:25] protocol in the crypto space and again
[00:21:27] similar to Unis swap starting to
[00:21:30] Showcase here at a minimum a clear
[00:21:33] sideways Trend here against Bitcoin
[00:21:35] finally we're starting to see some of
[00:21:37] these D5 plays keeping up pace with
[00:21:39] Bitcoin and showcasing the signs of
[00:21:41] potential Trend reversal with clear
[00:21:43] relative highs for the last year but
[00:21:46] along that as well being able to start
[00:21:48] establishing higher lows here this is
[00:21:50] the initial sign of a trend reversal
[00:21:52] here that we want to look for now for me
[00:21:54] I would really like to see it clear
[00:21:55] through the 200 day moving average this
[00:21:57] also again
[00:21:59] is something we saw within Unis swap
[00:22:01] here and also along with that as well
[00:22:03] for a once that started to happen we
[00:22:05] started to treat the tday more support
[00:22:07] rather than resistance then that's when
[00:22:09] things start to get interesting but
[00:22:11] above all it's keeping an eye on these
[00:22:12] different D5 protocols and the
[00:22:13] developments and the one thing I wanted
[00:22:15] to bring your attention towards is some
[00:22:16] of the big updates that have come for
[00:22:19] dyx when it came to their recent launch
[00:22:22] of dydx unlimited now dydx unlimited is
[00:22:25] one of the biggest updates that came to
[00:22:26] the protocol throughout the past couple
[00:22:28] years years I've been following it I've
[00:22:29] been kind of toying around testing with
[00:22:31] dyx since back in 2020 I used to mess
[00:22:34] around with all kinds of different D5
[00:22:36] protocols back in 2019 2020 and DX has
[00:22:39] really stood the test of time a lot of
[00:22:40] come and gone and the recent launch of
[00:22:43] unlimited and some of the new
[00:22:44] technologies like mega Volt have left me
[00:22:46] really impressed and really excited
[00:22:48] about defi again so for those who don't
[00:22:50] know the mega Volt is a way where you
[00:22:52] can essentially provide liquidity across
[00:22:54] all of the different spot and leverage
[00:22:57] pairs with in the overall dyx exchange
[00:23:00] so you can see here that essentially
[00:23:02] there are 161 Holdings currently for the
[00:23:04] massive 79.5 million position within the
[00:23:08] mega Volt this is again people who are
[00:23:11] possibly putting in a couple hundred
[00:23:12] bucks people who are putting in millions
[00:23:14] of dollars essentially being able to act
[00:23:15] as effective market makers for all these
[00:23:18] different pairings and the cool thing
[00:23:19] about that is that the pool has already
[00:23:21] generated over $3 million the APR right
[00:23:25] now is 38% what you're effectively doing
[00:23:28] servicing as a market maker here within
[00:23:30] the dyx market and essentially it allows
[00:23:33] for this growing pool or liquidity of
[00:23:35] Vortex that just continues to grow over
[00:23:37] time and essentially make DX a more
[00:23:40] powerful decentralized exchange but also
[00:23:42] give people really great way to earn APR
[00:23:44] in a safe way within the market so it's
[00:23:46] a really exciting thing I've seen
[00:23:48] nothing like this in defi there are lots
[00:23:50] of vaults and yield farming things this
[00:23:51] one is actually focused on generating
[00:23:53] real APR here and I think it's
[00:23:55] definitely something you guys should be
[00:23:56] keeping on your radar but beyond that as
[00:23:58] well there's also a really cool feature
[00:24:00] of launchable or instant launch U
[00:24:02] instant launchable markets or inst
[00:24:04] instant listings that essentially allow
[00:24:06] you to be able to be the first kind of
[00:24:08] Market maker or liquidity provider for a
[00:24:10] whole range of different pairs directly
[00:24:12] from within dydx and there's a ton of
[00:24:14] different markets that could be launched
[00:24:16] within an instant here on the protocol
[00:24:19] without requesting permission without
[00:24:20] waiting around and you can essentially
[00:24:22] be one of the first people to provide
[00:24:24] such liquidity there have been a couple
[00:24:26] plays here like Thea this was an coin
[00:24:28] that was really doing a lot of moves
[00:24:30] over the last couple of weeks and months
[00:24:32] and Thea here is now listed on the
[00:24:34] exchange so you can start to get access
[00:24:36] to some of these plays here within the
[00:24:37] market and liquidity builds up over time
[00:24:40] here which will essentially allow you to
[00:24:42] trade in a whole range of different all
[00:24:43] coins as time progresses versus waiting
[00:24:46] around for centralized exchange listings
[00:24:48] I think it's a great way to not only
[00:24:50] help the exchange generate more Revenue
[00:24:51] but outside of this as well it's going
[00:24:53] to allow you to be able to get earlier
[00:24:55] access to some of these plays versus
[00:24:56] waiting around for the big sex listings
[00:24:58] like binance or coinbase so keep that in
[00:25:01] mind if you guys are interested take a
[00:25:02] look into what has been launched with
[00:25:04] the dydx unlimited era update and
[00:25:06] outside of this as well if you want to
[00:25:07] dive into the documentation around dydx
[00:25:10] unlimited you can find that as well
[00:25:12] within the doc section on their
[00:25:14] Community tab so I definitely recommend
[00:25:16] you guys dive into that another project
[00:25:17] that you should keep in your radar one
[00:25:19] of our other partners here in this
[00:25:20] channel has to do with The Narrative of
[00:25:22] lending and borrowing so as you all know
[00:25:24] we just talked about di5 being a really
[00:25:26] big emerging category here we're seeing
[00:25:28] it the price action right you don't need
[00:25:30] to really convince you of that but the
[00:25:32] big thing above all is that right now
[00:25:34] def lending and borrowing tokens mainly
[00:25:36] made up of a maker and compound are a
[00:25:41] fraction of the market cap they used to
[00:25:43] be and comparative to their fundamentals
[00:25:45] have one of the best tvl protocol fee
[00:25:49] generating structures uh versus their
[00:25:51] valuation right so they have some of the
[00:25:53] strongest fundamentals if we were to
[00:25:54] kind of use traditional benchmarks like
[00:25:57] we would for companies these these
[00:25:58] projects are still some of the titans of
[00:26:01] the industry yet they are trading at
[00:26:03] very moderate valuations versus a lot of
[00:26:05] different plays in the market and that's
[00:26:07] why I definitely recommend you not only
[00:26:08] keep an eye on a as we talked about
[00:26:10] earlier as well as decentralized
[00:26:11] exchange plays like uniswap that are
[00:26:13] still draining a great amount of fees
[00:26:16] and have the ability to eventually turn
[00:26:17] on a protocol fee considering their
[00:26:19] market share in the market and the
[00:26:20] changing regulation environment but
[00:26:22] outside of that as well I definitely
[00:26:24] recommend you guys keep an eye on Ellis
[00:26:25] Network Ellis network is one of our
[00:26:27] partners here in this Channel and
[00:26:29] they're also focused on really
[00:26:30] disrupting di by becoming a
[00:26:32] multi-service dii application and also
[00:26:35] providing multi-chain support servicing
[00:26:37] a whole range of different networks so
[00:26:39] essentially as we've talked about here
[00:26:41] Ellis network is tapped into the cosmos
[00:26:43] ecosystem and will leverage a whole
[00:26:45] range of other different ecosystems
[00:26:46] providing essentially the ability to
[00:26:48] swap simply the beautiful user interface
[00:26:50] here across a variety of different
[00:26:52] Market pairs but along L of those will
[00:26:53] have the ability to earn through simple
[00:26:55] staking or liquid mining where you
[00:26:57] essentially
[00:26:58] you can provide uh liquidity mining for
[00:27:00] a whole range of different pairs out
[00:27:02] there in the market but outside of that
[00:27:04] as well you also have perpetuals which
[00:27:06] is going to allow people to essentially
[00:27:08] trade a Perpetual contracts or
[00:27:10] essentially be able to trade on Leverage
[00:27:11] so this essentially is becoming a Vortex
[00:27:13] of services within the defi industry and
[00:27:16] I think that overall LS Network being
[00:27:18] able to do this is really exciting but
[00:27:20] outside of that as well there's also the
[00:27:22] main net um the main net airdrop
[00:27:25] campaign or Market incentivized campaign
[00:27:27] that's going on now so essentially if
[00:27:29] you guys haven't checked this out
[00:27:30] already I definitely recommend you guys
[00:27:33] continue participating in this this is a
[00:27:35] way where you can essentially earn
[00:27:36] points and be able to claim some of the
[00:27:38] airdrop from engaging in various
[00:27:40] different activities from within Ellis
[00:27:41] Network so you can do that obviously by
[00:27:43] swapping trading the pairs you already
[00:27:45] would be trading out there in the market
[00:27:47] right pairs like atom or Cosmos as a
[00:27:49] whole range of different other plays as
[00:27:51] well as liquidity Mining and staking
[00:27:52] Ellis so these are ways where you know
[00:27:54] you essentially have to have some kind
[00:27:55] of stake and Ellis or provide liquidity
[00:27:58] of some format in the different
[00:27:59] liquidity mining pairs that are
[00:28:00] available but you can also just swap as
[00:28:02] well as you would be if you're already
[00:28:04] going to be trading you might as well
[00:28:05] use Ellis in this case and be able to
[00:28:07] get some of those uh essentially airdrop
[00:28:09] or mining rewards from your activities
[00:28:11] so definitely check out the link Down
[00:28:12] Below in the description there's also an
[00:28:14] affiliation program where you can send
[00:28:15] your own referral link and refer people
[00:28:17] and collect fees uh from their
[00:28:19] activities within the alsis network so
[00:28:21] definitely check all that out down below
[00:28:23] in the description if you guys are
[00:28:24] interested to learn more but I think
[00:28:26] above all it's definitely something to
[00:28:27] keep on radar one of the emerging
[00:28:29] projects that I have on my radar at the
[00:28:30] moment so we talked a lot about the kind
[00:28:34] of short-term concerns uh when it comes
[00:28:36] to crypto in the market we're obviously
[00:28:39] still keeping up the idea that if things
[00:28:41] keep chugging along you know there could
[00:28:42] be an opportunity to buy the dip a lot
[00:28:44] of these plays and where we could look
[00:28:46] for that dip opportunity but I want to
[00:28:47] talk about what has me really concerned
[00:28:50] right I'm not worried that Bitcoin could
[00:28:52] pull back a little bit I'm not trying to
[00:28:53] be all doom and gloom that's all within
[00:28:54] the r of possibility what we got to talk
[00:28:57] about here is something I don't think a
[00:28:58] lot of people really have on the radar
[00:29:00] at the moment because to be honest times
[00:29:02] have been pretty good for the last year
[00:29:03] or two uh and anyone who's really been
[00:29:06] bearish has been kind of pushed to the
[00:29:08] side and I think that this is a period
[00:29:10] of time where bulls have gotten a little
[00:29:11] too euphoric and have stopped asking the
[00:29:13] big questions which is essentially what
[00:29:16] is the real risk of recession a real
[00:29:19] risk of a market correction not just in
[00:29:22] crypto you know moderate correction but
[00:29:24] I'm talking about a full you know 40 50%
[00:29:28] correction in Bitcoin a sizable
[00:29:30] correction in equities a real
[00:29:32] recessionary
[00:29:34] pullback are we at any risk of that now
[00:29:37] not saying it needs to be a housing
[00:29:38] market crash it doesn't have to be as
[00:29:40] dramatic as the dot
[00:29:42] bubble but I will say that the line of
[00:29:45] resistance we've been talking about for
[00:29:48] the last year or
[00:29:49] so right that's made up of the prior
[00:29:51] high of the dotom bubble and the prior
[00:29:54] highs of 1929 The Roaring 20s nearly 95
[00:29:58] years
[00:30:00] ago is starting to act a little bit more
[00:30:03] like resistance what looked like a clear
[00:30:05] breakthrough is looking like a
[00:30:06] short-term deviation and we have now
[00:30:09] gone back below that line of resistance
[00:30:12] and it's starting to act as resistance
[00:30:13] again the 21 Day not our friend anymore
[00:30:16] not acting a
[00:30:17] support and if we take a look at the for
[00:30:21] example 100 day and 200 day which is
[00:30:24] usually our kind of buy the dip range
[00:30:25] that's usually where buyers will come in
[00:30:27] and provide bids side support and
[00:30:28] continue pushing prices higher if that
[00:30:31] doesn't holds the 200 week is all the
[00:30:34] way down at 4500 points now that will be
[00:30:36] moving up over time but that can mean
[00:30:39] very well that a lot of the phenomenal
[00:30:41] gains we saw in 20124 right we saw from
[00:30:46] the beginning of the year right we're
[00:30:48] still up about 27% we're up a total
[00:30:50] about 30% at the peak of this rally
[00:30:52] throughout
[00:30:53] 2024 a lot of those gains could be
[00:30:56] essentially lost over the next couple of
[00:31:00] months a lot of people could get
[00:31:02] sidelined trapped in their positions and
[00:31:05] I wouldn't be so surprised that that
[00:31:07] could play out here considering the
[00:31:09] valuation multiple people are paying
[00:31:10] fundamentally the market is way
[00:31:12] overbought historically right I don't
[00:31:14] even be the one to tell you that but at
[00:31:16] the same time I understand is people
[00:31:17] will Echo a million times markets can
[00:31:20] remain irrational longer than you can
[00:31:22] remain solvent right trying to short the
[00:31:24] market I'm not here to tell you to go
[00:31:25] short the market what I'm here to say is
[00:31:28] that right now we're seeing some signs
[00:31:29] of exha exhaustion for the last month
[00:31:31] and a half here we've been pretty much
[00:31:33] neutral in the S&P 500 and it's coming
[00:31:35] up right here at historic resistance
[00:31:38] when I take a look as well there are a
[00:31:40] lot of different metrics that are
[00:31:42] sending sending big warning signs here
[00:31:44] about recessionary risk and the biggest
[00:31:46] one is the 10year to two-year spread the
[00:31:49] yield curve right and the uninversity
[00:31:58] and guys I'll just put it to you this
[00:32:00] way when we were retesting the 100 month
[00:32:03] and 200 week back in the past and we
[00:32:05] were starting to move up again this was
[00:32:08] January
[00:32:10] 2001 this was November of
[00:32:14] 2007 when that acceleration really
[00:32:16] starts to ramp up you're looking at a
[00:32:18] recession within a matter of anywhere
[00:32:20] from 3 to 6
[00:32:24] months this is a really damning sign for
[00:32:27] the trend of equities and assets as a
[00:32:29] whole and I'm not saying that equities
[00:32:31] can't go up today or over the next week
[00:32:34] I'm talking about the long-term
[00:32:35] perspective here and how we need to
[00:32:37] start getting a little bit prepared to
[00:32:39] perhaps maybe get a bit more comfortable
[00:32:41] with the cash position rather than being
[00:32:44] overly all in exposed assets so just
[00:32:47] keep that in mind here we don't want to
[00:32:48] get trapped here guys there are going to
[00:32:49] be a lot of people because they benefit
[00:32:51] from it telling you that you have to be
[00:32:53] all in on
[00:32:54] markets when in reality it may very well
[00:32:57] be one of the worse times to you know
[00:32:59] feel the fomo to get all into Bitcoin
[00:33:01] piling all your capital in so you can
[00:33:05] buy a fraction or a whole Bitcoin or a
[00:33:07] couple Bitcoin only to see those Bitcoin
[00:33:10] drop and diminish in value quite
[00:33:12] substantially over the next couple of
[00:33:13] months when you could have bought a lot
[00:33:15] more if you just held out
[00:33:18] right we got to really get out of the
[00:33:20] kind of hoddle hoddle you know
[00:33:22] constantly bu the DI mentality because
[00:33:23] eventually the Music
[00:33:26] Stops that same narrative that's been
[00:33:28] talked before that oh it's never going
[00:33:30] to end the there's never going to be
[00:33:32] another dip or anything that comes to
[00:33:34] ruin a lot of people and even if we were
[00:33:38] to just revisit the prior highs of
[00:33:40] December 2021 the euphoric highs from
[00:33:42] covid right that's about a 20% dip here
[00:33:46] in equities from the prior highs about
[00:33:48] 22% that is totally within the realm of
[00:33:52] possibility and it's going to wreck a
[00:33:55] lot of people if it plays out because a
[00:33:57] lot of people are not prepared for that
[00:33:58] a lot of people think because of AI um
[00:34:02] you know because of the lowering of
[00:34:03] interest rates that essentially asset
[00:34:06] prices can't correct like that well they
[00:34:08] most certainly can I'll tell you that
[00:34:10] right now and it can happen much faster
[00:34:12] than you may
[00:34:14] think we saw that here back in January
[00:34:17] 2022 here to October 27% pullback to the
[00:34:20] 200
[00:34:21] week that 200 week is coming up right
[00:34:25] nicely in alignment here over the next
[00:34:27] quarter to here with those prior highs
[00:34:31] or here with the lows of
[00:34:34] April totally within the Rong with
[00:34:36] possibility yield curve unversioned out
[00:34:39] resistance at 95
[00:34:42] yearlong resistance ascending resistance
[00:34:45] mind you so we're giving room for the
[00:34:46] Bulls to essentially continue pushing
[00:34:48] prices higher lots of wiggle room here
[00:34:51] clearly acting as resistance for about a
[00:34:53] month and a half and you know we also
[00:34:56] have the the price of oil right
[00:34:59] now still remaining below the 100 month
[00:35:02] since back in September over 4 months
[00:35:07] now oil moving
[00:35:09] lower yield curve un inverting S&P 500
[00:35:13] seeing resistance
[00:35:16] volatility showcasing some worrying
[00:35:18] signs
[00:35:19] here for the first time uh you know back
[00:35:23] the last couple of
[00:35:24] months first serious uptick here biggest
[00:35:28] one since back in
[00:35:31] August keep an ey it guys I'm all for
[00:35:35] for making money in the markets I'm all
[00:35:36] for looking at buy the dip opportunities
[00:35:38] the nice thing about that is we always
[00:35:40] approach things from a kind of uh medium
[00:35:42] risk medium reward perspective you know
[00:35:44] we like to buy on dips we don't buy into
[00:35:45] Euphoria right once we get those
[00:35:47] corrective opportunities we can enter
[00:35:49] and we can watch to see how price is
[00:35:50] reacting if we you know essentially have
[00:35:53] our stops hitter we we have to close out
[00:35:54] our positions it's not the end of the
[00:35:55] world cuz we didn't buy the alltime high
[00:35:57] eyes right and we take the loss or
[00:36:00] something if it moves up that's great uh
[00:36:02] then we can you know make money and
[00:36:04] continue riding with the kind of up and
[00:36:06] to the right narrative where asset
[00:36:08] prices generally move in the long run
[00:36:10] but we'll at least be protected from the
[00:36:13] worst case
[00:36:14] scenario which could throw off a lot of
[00:36:18] people they'll catch you off guard when
[00:36:20] you least expect it so I Ram but on get
[00:36:24] them out here guys keep an eye on that
[00:36:26] Bitcoin chart keep an eye on on that
[00:36:27] line of resistance from the two PR highs
[00:36:29] in 2021 the peak of the last bull market
[00:36:34] and keep open to the possibility that
[00:36:38] just like what we saw back here could
[00:36:41] repeat yet again could be multiple
[00:36:44] months of stagnation could be a more
[00:36:46] harsh
[00:36:47] correction or who knows maybe we reclaim
[00:36:50] that 21 day and I'm just blowing a lot
[00:36:53] of smoke
[00:36:55] here I'm just here to look out for you
[00:36:58] guys as much as I can and hopefully
[00:37:00] share more fruitful and more middle down
[00:37:03] the road opinion what you're probably
[00:37:04] hearing from a lot of other people in
[00:37:06] the crypto space I love crypto I think
[00:37:07] there's a lot of exciting things about
[00:37:09] it I definitely can see Bitcoin um you
[00:37:11] know maturing as this kind of financial
[00:37:13] instrument for people to be able to
[00:37:15] hedge against Global
[00:37:18] currencies other asset classes but at
[00:37:20] the end of the day it is still a risk on
[00:37:23] asset alt coins absolutely are a risk on
[00:37:26] asset and we got to treat it like that
[00:37:28] right doesn't mean we can't have some
[00:37:30] exposure to it doesn't mean you can't
[00:37:31] have like a hotle portfolio but if
[00:37:33] you're more of an active Trader like me
[00:37:34] especially if we're talking alt coins
[00:37:37] you got to be able to be disciplined
[00:37:38] enough to close your positions when it's
[00:37:40] favorable to do so so thanks so much
